    <thetext>From comments on bug 151655: in the common scenario where a subtask is matched by a query it will show up twice, once under the query and once under the task it is a subtask of.  The content provider should be smart enough to prevent this from happening.  At that point we can change the "Filter subtasks" option to:

   Subtask Presentation
       -&gt; Flat
       -&gt; Hierarchical</thetext>

Since I belive this is the same situation I have noticed myself, let me add some additional info: With Filter Subtasks option on, subtasks matched by a query are visible as children, but when we collapse the parent task we won't be able to expand it back. The [+] disappears.</thetext>

    <thetext>I was wondering if the old FILTER_SUBTASKS preference key could be deprecated instead of deleted since I have a connector that is highly dependent on subtasks and therefore had this value set to false on startup.

&gt; Rob: now that this is done the "Filter Subtasks" action was no longer accurate.
&gt; I changed it to "Group Subtasks", changed labels, and inverted the check of the
&gt; preference accordingly.

I think "Group subtask" is really confusing. Note that in bugzilla subtasks can come anywhere outside of the project/query, so it is clearly not a grouping. I think "show subtasks" would be more accurate.</thetext>

    <thetext>Yes, the goal is supporting arbitrary levels of dependencies.

In terms of naming, here are the options we considered.  Please feel free to vote for one or suggest another: 
1) Group Subtasks
2) Nest Subtasks
3) Nest Dependent Tasks
3) Group Dependent Tasks

Note that although "nest" is a good word, it is less obvious than group, and less consistent if we end up with other "group" options, e.g. "Group by &lt;property&gt;".  Another constraint is that the option name has to be connector agnostic, and the word "dependency" is Bugzilla specific.</thetext>

    <thetext>Mik, can you please elaborate what is wring with using "show" in relation to the subtasks? So far all kind of grouping been a presentation property (i.e. group by category), so it is completely unobvious and confusing, because this pseudo "grouping" can bring tasks into visibility that do NOT belong to given query.</thetext>

    <thetext>I assume that you are suggesting using "Show Subtasks".  The problem with that is that subtasks are still shown (i.e. visible under the query) when the option is disabled.  The difference is that they are not nested under their parents, just shown as a flat list instead.  So unless I'm missing something the correct verb is one of: group, nest, cascade.</thetext>

    <thetext>I still don't see anything wrong with showing subtasks under query, but "grouping" something that is not even match query criteria don't make any sense, especially after you've been saying for over a year how bad it is to show something that don't match query criteria (i.e. completed tasks under query configured to show only incomplete tasks).</thetext>

    <thetext>Only things that match query criteria should be included in the grouping.

Rob: I just checked and it looks like we have a small bug with the guaranteed visibility rule for this.   Most cases work, but if I have a task that's matched by a query, and another subtask that should have guaranteed visibility, the task will show as a subtask in a query that it's not matched by.</thetext>

    <thetext>(In reply to comment #18)
&gt; Only things that match query criteria should be included in the grouping.

I guess we have misunderstanding what subtask is. Let me reiterate and forgive me if I'll state something obvious.

It is natural to show all subtasks (even those that don't match query), i.e. some Mylar issue can depend on SWT or JFace fix and it would be confusing and completely unintuitive if task list would show only subset of subtasks under given task node.

On the other hand, if one of those shown subtasks does appear in the query results, it may make sense to filter out those, since they will be shown as subtasks under other query tasks. But I am not very certain about that, because it would de-flatten the task list and interfere with planning and prioritization.</thetext>

    <thetext>Constraint is that the option needs to be on when hierararchical mode is enabled, otherwise connectors that opt-out of disabling this option end up with confusing or incorrect UI.  Brainstorming more options for the label:
1) Nest Dependent Tasks
2) Show Subtask Hierarchy
3) Nest Subtasks
4) Group Subtasks
5) Show Subtasks
6) Hierarchical Subtasks

Clearest, eh? From the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nest  
---
A nest is place of refuge built to hold an animal's eggs and/or provide a place to raise their offspring. They are usually made of some organic material such as twigs, grass, and leaves; or may simply be a depression in the ground, or a hole in a tree, rock or building. Sometimes available human made materials such as string, plastic, cloth, hair, paper, etc. may be used as well.

Sorry, couldn't resist. :-)

    <thetext>+1 for: Show Sub-tasks as Tree

(to make the wording consistent with the search view)

If we don't want a dash in sub-task we should change the JIRA connector to be consistent which is currently consistent with the JIRA web-interface.

I am in favor of enabling it by default if the same tasks show up as sub-tasks independently of the query. This option will be somewhat confusing since it will mean something else for JIRA namely to filter sub-tasks from the list.

&gt; +1 for: Show Sub-tasks as Tree
&gt; (to make the wording consistent with the search view)

I don't think it is relevant to the task list, because Search view is actually flip between flat and tree presentation, but task list still going to use tree. So, we either show subtasks or don't show them.</thetext>

    <thetext>We haven't converged on what to call this option, so we will keep it as Group Subtasks.  "Show Subtasks" is inaccurate for Bugzilla so that couldn't be used.  "Show Subtasks as Tree" is too implementation-centric because it is about the data structure and not the presentation, and not all users of Mylyn will be immediately familiar with the term Tree.  Nest is just a bit weird.  "Show Subtask Hierarchy" is pretty good but long, that one could have my vote if we change this in a future releas.e

Main work on the bug is done.  Note about changing the label added to the Mylyn UI Nits page.</thetext>

It depends. Showing things that happens to be subtasks of something else at the root of the query results is a separate story.</thetext>

    <thetext>We currently download the configuration data on every 10th synchronization, which with default settings will happen be every 10 x 20 minutes when connected and using repository tasks/queries.  On the bugs.eclipse.org repository the current configuration size is 900K, so this adds up to considerable network traffic (see http://eclipsewebmaster.blogspot.com/2007/07/mylyn-popularity-busy-bugzilla.html ).  We should explore ways to optmizie network usage, e.g.:

* [cheaper] Reduce the interval to be every 100th download.  This would need to be done in conjunction with an "Update Attributes" button in the Task Editor since the attributes would be much more likely to go stale.

* [better] Figure out a mechanism to determine whether the attributes have changed.  Since we don't yet have a way of determining this we should file a bug against bugzilla.mozilla.org and explore options (e.g. trying to get the size of the file to see if it changed before downloading all contents).</thetext>

    <thetext>Another option: could Mylyn look for a config.cgi.xml *before* (and instead of) loading config.cgi?  If the xml file doesn't exist, config.cgi is then loaded. That way the admin of a large, busy site could simply auto-generate a static (and cacheable) xml file as needed.</thetext>

    <thetext>Denis, both options sound reasonable to me.  Another option could be to write a short Perl script to dump a last modified timestamp to a config.timestamp file. We could then (if available) use this timestamp as the bases for 'synchronization' of the repository configuration. </thetext>

I think that's the right way to go. HTTP provides some good caching options. Thoset should be leveraged instead of forcing the Bugzilla maintainers to add some extra scripts and processing to their servers just to support Mylyn. It should be easy to remember the last modified time somewhere. Maybe Mylyn could help the Bugzilla developers with a patch.

Gunnar, that could be a dangerous option. Timestamp on the cached document does help to save the traffic, but it would also make impossible to see if server configuration had changed and may lead to abuse of the no-cache option. There was several reports that users don't immediately see updated configuration because it is not being retrieved instantly. Such issue probably would need some special support on the server. Either a separate timestamp document like Rob suggested, or explicitly clean the cached document and its timestamp upon any configuration change.</thetext>

That would only happen if it would be poorly implemented. However, from the discussion in the bug I got the impression that this won't happen.

Mhm. I don't see why there should be a need for this. Each browser has a refresh button and a possibility to clear the cache and reload the content from the server. Even Mylyn could have a refresh button that a user explicitly invokes. 

&gt; Either a separate timestamp document like
&gt; Rob suggested, or explicitly clean the cached document and its timestamp upon
&gt; any configuration change.

That's weird because nobody other than Mylyn would benefit from this solution. Sorry but I don't see any Bugzilla committer accepting such a patch. Moreover, writing the last-modified date into a separate file is nothing more than using validation based caching (see [1]) by avoiding the HTTP capabilities and reinventing the wheel.

I am not an expert with all the caching options and got confused by the Dennis's comment about external squid proxy. So, I was just trying to explain the use case, that Bugzilla client like Mylyn would really benefit from the ability to detect configuration change without explicit refresh or force actions. It is not an issue in the web UI, because web UI shows these changes immediately and users somehow expect similar behavior in the rich UI.</thetext>

I think that Squid will know how to deal with the caching options of HTTP. However, if you have a caching server in between that really enforces caching than you'll loose anyway because the separate file containing your time stamp would also be cached.</thetext>

I think you should also consider typical usage of Mylin. I use it to schedule and structure (love those auto CVS comments) my own web work on  my own bugzilla/CVS server.

I also use Mylin to follow bugs I found and reported in tools I use, either Eclipse, some tool vendor or on bugs.mysql.com. But this is less imprtant than my own repository. So we need a 'learning' Mylin that can see whether it is my main bugzilla or just like a news reader. Can you query Mylin users how many active repositories they have? I have 4.

My main suggestion make the refresh interval(s) user configurable per repository instance:
every 200/4000 minutes, at startup only (for lower interest sites), every week. 
Similar to but also much better that auto-update ;-)

The second is to not refresh when it is not in the current Working Set, to get some sort of demand/usage driven reduction.

&gt; configuration change.

Summarizing Eugene,  Maarten's and others' suggestions (and Mik's guidelines on bug#196021), here's how I think we should proceed:

1) Improve Mylyn's config refresh policy
   - For 2.1 we will add an explicit attributes refresh button (bug#162428) and set auto refresh to happen once daily if Auto-synchronization is enabled
2) Ask Bugzilla to provide a timestamp file that is updated upon each config change 
3) Ask server administrators to cache the config output and invalidate frequently
3a) Consider extending Bugzilla to invalidate the cached copy when when config changes

(1) should reduce traffic significantly without sacrificing user experience
(2) is required in order to maintain the level of transparency that we're after
(3) can be done as needed by server admins

Denis, does this sound like a reasonable course of action from here?

    <thetext>Using a timestamp file still requires a full config download. Would it be more economical to request a config delta from a certain date?
The the return message will then be all config changes since the requested date or an empty delta.
Thus bugzilla will not resend information already present in Mylin.

    <thetext>There are essentially three problems here:

1. config.cgi wastes lots of cpu power, because the file is generated dynamically each time (cpu on the webserver (noticeable) + cpu on the database (negligeable))

2. config.cgi wastes bandwidth, as our repository is fairly large (almost 1MB)

3. I don't really know when the repository changes, so I woudln't know what to put in the timestamp file

This morning I solved (1) -- and perhaps (2) by simply moving config.cgi to config-stock.cgi, and replacing config.cgi with a script that simply sends the raw RDF data from a static file (config.xml). The static file is regenerated after x minutes.  In doing so, I send the appropriate HTTP/1.1 cache headers and content-length, so Mylyn could simply HEAD the file first to see if the size has changed since the last fetch.

Since doing this, I no longer see any config.cgi processes as using lots of cpu power, and config.cgi loads in milliseconds vs. seconds (the bottleneck being your internet connection).  Our web server's CPU load has decreased noticeably.


Here is my revised config.cgi script:

#!/usr/bin/perl

$filename = "/path/to/config.xml";
$filename2 = "/path/to/config.xml2";
$fileage = -M $filename;

$fileage = sprintf("%d", $fileage * 1440);   # in minutes plz

if($fileage &gt; 15) {
        system ("/path/to/wget -O $filename2 https://bugs.eclipse.org:8443/bugs/config-stock.cgi?ctype=rdf; cp $filename2 $filename");
}

$filesize = -s $filename;

print "Content-type: application/rdf+xml\n";
print "Cache-Control: max-age=3600, must-revalidate\n";
print "Content-Length: " . $filesize . "\n";
print "\n";
open (FILE, $filename);
print &lt;FILE&gt;;
close FILE;

    <thetext>Because no one probably put any serious thought into the "every 10th synchronization" algorithm, I thought it would be fun to see what kind of impact this has on us.

I tailed the logfiles for GET /bugs/config.cgi requests for 5 minutes.  Note that only Mylyn fetches this config.cgi file.

Total requests: 142
28.4 req/minute, one request every 2 seconds

Total transfer size for 5 minutes: 121 megabytes, or 413 KB/sec (3.22 megabits/sec)

If this field isn't available we'll simply assume that an update is required as per usual.

&gt; &gt; If this field isn't available we'll simply assume that an update is required
&gt; as
&gt; &gt; per usual.
&gt; 
&gt; We could fairly easily add a Last-Modified header as well if you'd rather have
&gt; that to go on than Content-length.

This would be better if possible since this would more closely mirror how the rest of our synchronization works. Denis could you update your script to include this?

The first call shouldn't be very expensive though since we will just request the header on the first call:

I meant that it won't be expensive to the client, but for unmodified bugzilla the HEAD may trigger same database activity as the GET request, unless of course bugzilla explicitly handles the HEAD request already.</thetext>

    <thetext>Indeed, HEAD and GET are identical to Bugzilla.

+1 for comment 23 - do a HEAD for the first access, then if the Last-Modified header is received, then you know it's a "smart" bugzilla.  Otherwise, you assume a stock bugzilla and store that state.

I'd suggest this approach over hard-coding our site, as a proxy/caching server can also yield the same cacheable config.cgi without needing to modify bugzilla.</thetext>

    <thetext>Attempt is now made to use Last-Modified header field, if not available subsequent attempts will default to retrieve configuration. If at later date an admin updates the repository to use this last-modified field, the user can re-enable use of this Last-Modified by selecting Task Repository Settings &gt; Additional Settings &gt; Cached Configuration. At some point we could consider automatically checking for this at some random interval so that the user is not responsible for this setting.

Repository configuration is now only updated upon first synch (i.e. shortly after a workbench startup) and then subsequently once daily.

Denis, if you could update bug.eclipse.org to return the Last-Modified field, aside from some manual testing, I think we're done here.</thetext>

Great! If you're are on the latest Mylyn dev build, open your Eclipse.org Task Repository settings and enable Cached Configuration under Additional Settings. Subsequent configuration synchronization will be more efficient. I'll make this known via Mylyn mailing lists and faq.

    <thetext>Reopening.

I noticed that for September, config.cgi requests totaled just over 2 terabytes (!!) of transfer.  This is about 10% of eclipse.org's total bandwidth, including downloads.

After some investigation, it became clear that the Mylyn client is not using the caching and expiry tags we set in comment 28, as notmany requests have a 304 "not modified" header.  Each request translated to a complete transfer of our repository, which is 950KB in size.

I used wget to make sure that caching was actually possible, and it is:
wget --header "If-Modified-Since: Tue, 02 Oct 2007 13:18:20 GMT"--delete-after -S --no-check-certificate https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/config.cgi
[snip]
HTTP request sent, awaiting response...
  HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
  Date: Tue, 02 Oct 2007 13:25:18 GMT
  Server: Apache
  Connection: Keep-Alive
  Keep-Alive: timeout=3, max=100
  Expires: Wed, 3 Oct 2007 13:13:46 GMT
  Cache-Control: max-age=86400, must-revalidate
09:25:18 ERROR 304: Not Modified.

From here, I can think of a couple of solutions:

1. MUST: Mylyn needs to send the correct if-modified-since header and expect a 304 in return if no changed have been made

2. SHOULD: Mylyn should store the size of the last repo transfer, then send a HEAD request and compare the current size.

3. SHOULD: Mylyn should not do more than 1 complete repo transfer per day. The repo doesn't change very often, so performing a sync more often is just wasteful

4. WOULD BE NICE: Mylyn could have a preference, default to 2 days, which would allow users to tweak how often it checks for changes.  This would allow users with low bandwidth to optimize Mylyn's usage according to their needs

In the interim, our current config.cgi will alternate between periods of 404 and 200 to spare our bandwidth.</thetext>

    <thetext>Denis: whenever we are in a period of 404 the Mylyn Bugzilla tool will be broken for any user who has not already created their queries (e.g. is a new user, creating a new query, refreshing attributes for a query).  In other words Mylyn will currently appear broken to a big portion of the users trying to use it on bugs.eclipse.org and we are in a very bad state.

Please note that the fix for this bug did not get released to the masses until last Friday's Europa Fall Update, to which people are just updating to now.  In other words, all those Mylyn clients were not using the cached configuration in September (only the small subset of the early adopters of our more frequent builds would have bene using those).

Since we're currently in a time of impending doom, could you please reactivate the config.cgi script while we figure out a solution that won't cause people accessing bugs.eclipse.org to break?  We fully appreciate the need to minimize bandwidth usage and will do anything that's needed to assist in this.  Hopefully we will see a huge drop once people update to the Europa Fall Update.  

In the meantime Rob and I will investigate further.</thetext>

From my experience with such large distributed systems that's still way too often. I suggest at maximum once per week. Even once per month should be well sufficient in terms of bugs.eclipse.org.

I upgraded from earlier Mylyn version and checking just now, noticed that cached configuration is NOT on.
So the setting is not updated if you have eclipse.org defined form an earlier version of mylyn, as, I suspect, the majority of users will have.

I think 'somebody' should hardcode a check for this on start up and put up an annoyance dialog on startup if eclipse.org is NOT cached, with option to do so from the dialog.
I cannot think of a reason not to cache when eclipse.org supports it.
THis of course until it is resolved in another way...</thetext>

&gt; "not modified" header.  Each request translated to a complete transfer of our
&gt; repository, which is 950KB in size.
Server side caching does indeed resolve the load on the CPU but not the bandwidth.
Client side caching reduces unnecessary requests, but we have to look also at size of each legitimate request.
  
config.cgi is very nicely formatted xml+rdf.
As an thought experiment I removed all extraneous spaces and newlines using BBEdits format/compact.
Size count  as now delivered: 996546 chars, 20419 lines
Size count  with spaces and newlines stripped: 667460chars, 2 lines

Whoops! Size reduced by 33%!!!!

We have to find out if this condensed form is properly parsed by Mylyn, if so it provides a
quite easy way to instantly reduce the bandwidth requirement by 33% s follows:

Make your caching code (see comment #13 above) also strip these extra spaces and newlines...

As there is so much redundancy in both the XML markup (tags) and the content (the lead part of the URL is the same for every item!!) its also a prime candidate for on the fly compression, for example gzip.
My local stock config: 88854 bytes, trimmed using perl script: 62087 bytes, then gzipped: 4297 bytes.
Your config.cgi is 996546, trimmed it is 667460 and then gzipped would be 28501!!

That is just for the config.cgi. But every bug served to Mylyn is served as XML, how are those formatted (also much whitespace), can they be compressed easily?

Mik,
My suggestion would be: make the mylyn.web.core accept gzip as well as encoding and then add mod_gzip to eclipse.org to reduce the size of ALL Mylyn traffic. The mylyn.web.core is used for all web traffic after all, so every repository in the world can potentially benefit if they can send gzipped XML. That would really make Mylyn well behaved in terms of bandwidth, but not server CPU.

Denis,
As your already caching the config.xml, its no big deal to gzip this file once its regenerated. That would leave the option open to use mod_gzip everywhere or just gzip the cached big config files.</thetext>

&gt; candidate for on the fly compression, for example gzip.

On the fly compression comes at the expense of CPU power, although for something fairly static like config.cgi, I agree with you that gzip'ing it once then serving it thousands of times makes sense.

However, IMHO, if the config.cgi file is properly cached, and is stripped of extraneous characters, I think we've trimmed a substantial amount of fat within the realm of being practical.

Our bugzilla serves about a gazillion pages a day (more when we allow google/msn spiders to index us), so I can imagine mod_gzip having a noticeable impact on our CPUs. It's a constant struggle to walk the fine line between one bottleneck and another.</thetext>

We are happy to consume the file in the format that best suits eclipse.org's needs and (by having a customized Mylyn Bugzilla connector with additional handling and heuristics for the bugs.eclipse.org repository).  Our JIRA Connector already handles mod_gzip so that would be a straightforward change.  Alternatively we could consider retrieving a cached config.xml.zip type file that's updated on a schedule.  Either change would need to be backwards compatible with existing Mylyn clients by continuing to serve the current config.cgi unzipped.  Denis, if you propose a solution we can iterate and make sure our client can handle it gracefully and have a fallback if anything goes wrong.

Maarten: the most likely reason for your Cached Configuration setting getting turned off is, ironically, that your once-per-day background updated of attributes happened just after config.cgi started 404'ing, which made Mylyn assume that the Cached Configuration was not available on bugs.eclipse.org and fall back to the standard Bugzilla config.cgi.  We could have Mylyn try to eagerly fall back to the cached configuration in this scenario as a special rule for the bugs.eclipse.org.</thetext>

To further this search for optimizing spots: where is the cached configuration stored?
It feels like workspace , since as I alternate between mylyn and work workspaces during the day, it feels like each one gets updated on every switch.
Repository access information and cached config data  should be stored once per machine I feel.</thetext>

    <thetext>I've committed the eclipse.org config.cgi script to the Phoenix "Infra Scripts" repository.  We can use it as a reference for other sites, and we'll be able to accept code patches. Maarten, thanks for your contribution.

Let's have config.cgi specific discussions via new bugs against Phoenix (cc'ing the Mylyn team) so that this bug can focus on the frequency/caching of Mylyn (which, from what I read, can perhaps be WORKSFORME).</thetext>

Bugzilla client accepting gzipped configuration

As the config.cgi is already caching and stripping superfluous spaces for 30% size reduction, why not go the whole way and gzip the resulting file as well. 
The bugzilla server can then decide to send the stripped version to older clients and the much smaller (-90%) gzip encoded version to newer patched clients.</thetext>

Great. Patch applied. 

I'll update the connector so that it attempts use of 'cached config' each workbench start so if it fails for one session due to unavailability etc, upon restart it has a chance to reenable. This will eliminate the need for the preference in the settings page as well.</thetext>

Code should handle redirect to gzipped file as well

When using a modified config.cgi, the accept-encoding: gzip  and content-encoding: gzip headers can be used, but when load is distributed using mod_rewrite (incombination with BrowserMatch, bug 205213) the redirect ends up on just a gziopped file, that will be sent with Content-Type: application/x-gzip headers.

THis patch handles both cases so that webmaster for all bugzilla's have the freedom to chose their setup (perl, mod_rewrite, mod_gzip, etc).</thetext>

This action is JDT/Junit specific, and as such is better in the org.eclipse.mylyn.java.ui plug-in, so I moved it there.  I also renamed it to "New Task from Failure..." and used the standard New Task icon.  I also changed the string "Error Log" to "Failure Log".

    <thetext>Maybe just add this to the CloneTaskAction (now it only sets a comment with back link url) or in a more extensive implementation in the bugzilla task, 
See latest patch in bug 161646: [patch] Support for Clone this bug. It contains a stub in NewBugzillaTaskEditor to handle setting more fields, if it recognizes them.</thetext>

    <thetext>Is there any way that we could make this something that is extensible?  I see that Jira already contributes this type of action and it would be nice to have api for it so that developers do not have to copy this action for each connector.</thetext>

    <thetext>Yes, I would definitely like this to be a common action.  The driver for generalizing it can be Bugzilla, which to start could just copy the right components.

Stefen,

should I  look at this?

If so, what other attributes did you have in mind?</thetext>

    <thetext>Sounds great, Frank. Take a look at JiraTaskDataHandler.initializeSubTaskData() and the corresponding action in JIRA. For Bugzilla this should work the same way, a single click action to open the editor for creating a sub-task. The Blocks attribute should be set to the parent task, not the Depends On attribute as the descriptions suggests.

You can use the AbstractTaskDataHandler.cloneTaskData() method for copying other attributes. I haven't done that for JIRA, yet, but it should be straight forward.</thetext>

I looked at this and have a Question.

Should I move NewSubTaskAction from org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.jira.ui.actions to org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.task.ui.actions or should I create an Bugzilla specific Action.

&gt; 
&gt; You can use the AbstractTaskDataHandler.cloneTaskData() method for copying other
&gt; attributes. I haven't done that for JIRA, yet, but it should be straight
&gt; forward.

My implementation use AbstractTaskDataHandler.cloneTaskData so Summery and Description get set from the parent. Is this OK.

When I get the answer I will post soon an Patch.

&gt; Should I move NewSubTaskAction from org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.jira.ui.actions
&gt; to org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.task.ui.actions or should I create an Bugzilla
&gt; specific Action.

It is okay to duplicate the action code for now. We can generalize later on.

&gt; My implementation use AbstractTaskDataHandler.cloneTaskData so Summery and
&gt; Description get set from the parent. Is this OK.

It seems that this does make much sense for a subtasks as it will a specific summary and description to that task. How about reseting these to empty strings after cloning?</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks Frank! Patch looks great to me. The only minor thing that should be changed is the label for the action, it should be "Subtask". Rob, assigning to you for reviews, since the patch touches Bugzilla code.</thetext>

    <thetext>Patch applied, ip log updated. Frank, I've applied this but with application for all bugzilla versions.  I think we are safe with this change since this is originally how the code worked. I will test today and will include in tonight's 2.2RC build so there will be some mileage on it before Friday.</thetext>

Are you sure you used GzipPostMethod to do this POST request?
If not we loose the potential bandwidth savings again...

&gt; I wonder if there is a hard limit for number of tasks to search like this in
&gt; MySQL... it may worth to check that.

Yes this would be very valuable information.  We'd have to look at the sql executed by Bugzilla's buglist.cgi script.

GzipPostMethod is used (See bugzillaClient.getSearchHits(...))

proposed patch

Here is proposed patch that makes depends on field fill in available space.

There is a more fundamental problem though. The hyperlink list below "depends on" field is using Composite with RowLayout, however the RowLayout don't play well with scrollable form. In other words, elements in the Composite are never wrapped, and instead always increase form width, making horizontal scrollbar appear on the form. I think it will be better to convert "depends on" and "blocks" field into the SourceViewer and use special hyperlink detector right in the text field (i.e. with Ctrl modifier). See some discussion about this on bug 167866</thetext>

    <thetext>Rob: this may be superseded by your other editor work, since we are planning to make the subtasks UI more explicit.  Since this is a trivial change you can consider making it now.

Eugene: as you know, we still cannot apply your patches.  For the time being, please suggest implementation approaches before providing patches.</thetext>

task editor for bug 211072

Is there anything prevents from applying patch submitted for this issue?

Ideally it would be nice to remove the second line and perhaps use wrapped text area that would allow to see all issues without bowing up the task editor width.</thetext>

Fyi I checked and we do not have those commit permissions on record for you.  </thetext>

split adapter factory

This patch moves dependencies from adapter factory into a separate plugin (also moved factory initialization into plugin.xml).

However there is another dependency on CVS plugin from ContextChangeSet class.</thetext>

    <thetext>Patch applied, thanks Eugene.  To complete this I will also need to remove our dependency on CVSActiveChangeSet (see comment#20 on bug 142395).  That will have to wait post 2.0.  What's good is that we have the plug-in split for Europa since it is likely that we will be able to keep the APIs the same.</thetext>

    <thetext>Eugene: I was able to use some parts of your patch, although I reworked a bunch of it.  The change to LinkedTaskInfo did not work as expected because we invoke the comment check.  To address this Steffen and I changed ContextChangeSet.  Also, just fyi we change the adapter access to avoid use of internals:
	return AdapterManager.getDefault().getAdapter(this, adapter);
To:
		return Platform.getAdapterManager().getAdapter(this, adapter);
		
The more major change we did as part of this is listed under the "Changed Team API" section of the porting guide.  ILinkedTaskInfo is now AbstractTaskReference with a getText() method for textual references (e.g. comments, messages).  We moved it out of tasks.core because we don't know of any clients outside of team plug-ins.  Do you have any clients that need to access it from tasks.core?</thetext>

    <thetext>Mik, thanks for the update. Though it is very unfortunate that you have chanced API for ILinkedTaskInfo. This will require to update team integrations, which wasn't really expected. I am not sure when I'll have chance to update Subclipse implementation for this.</thetext>

    <thetext>We realize the pains of making integrators update, and regarding the Team APIs, we left them unchanged for Mylyn 2.0 for this reason.  But we are planning on making Mylyn 3.0 the last major API revision, and as such it is important that we prioritize API quality this time around.  We will provide very clear porting guide steps for making the change.</thetext>

    <thetext>Currently,  the Bugzilla client tests for the presence of a specific value in the response body when logging in to confirm valid authentication.  The content should not be relied upon as this is brittle and can break when the repository has been customized.  One possible solution would be to test for presence of the bugzilla login cookie in the returned header upon successful validation.</thetext>

    <thetext>When I go to add an attachment, I'm greeted with the text "Clipboard contents are for text attachments only."  However, when I get to the next page in the "add attachment" wizard, I'm allowed to select the Content Type, including various image mime types.

The behavior I would want is like this.  If my clipboard has text in it, I click Next and then I can select from text/plain, text/html, or application/xml for the Content Type.  If there is an image in my clipboard, I can click Next and then select from image/gif, image/jpeg, or image/png as the Content Type.  The plugin would convert from the clipboard image to whichever Content Type is selected.</thetext>

    <thetext>I added bug 78856 as a dependency.

In any case, and maybe this should be logged as a different bug, the UI should prevent you from creating a text attachment from the clipboard and marking it with a Content Type of image/*.

    <thetext>It would be nice to have this feature, since it is a pain for people to have to use an external program just to generate an image.

Brock: do you still have this code?  I assume that you had it working for Windows only?

    <thetext>Patch applied.  Excellent work, this will be a *very* useful feature for helping users point out problems.  I now think that it is worth investing a bit more time in enahncing this functionality, so I created bug 195689 and bug 195691.</thetext>

    <thetext>I am concerned. Current implementation takes full screen screenshot instead of the particular window (or even just a selected view or editor). It also forces editor where screenshot will be attached into the focus. Both of those restrictions significantly limiting use of this feature.

Possible alternative could be allow configurable delay before screenshot is taken to allow user to hide or bring up required parts. 

Another option is have a toolbar button that would take screenshot and stick it into the clipboard. It could use proprietary transfer object and don't have to wait for image transfer in SWT, so "clipboard" option on attach dialog would be able to recognize that image.</thetext>

    <thetext>I think the configurable delay is way too complex.  The typical way that tools deal with this is to allow you to select the window/area to be captured, or to allow you to edit the screenshot afterwards (disucssion about that should go on bug 195689).  I was tempted to file a bug for clipboard-based capture since that would be my preferred way of doing it (works great on Windows) but that's an advanced UI too and many advanced users already know how to create and capture screenshots.

Balazs: is it easy for you to turn the clipboard contents into a captured image if they are a bitmap, or is that OS-specific behavior?</thetext>

&gt; I think the configurable delay is way too complex.  

I don't think it is and it is often the only option if you need to capture menus, popups or tooltips

Well, advanced users also can fill bugs trough the web interface, but we should make things quick and easy even for those users.

Reading clipboard populated by PrtScreen or Alt-PrtScreen would require bug 78856. Though that bug has a patch that could allow to handle that on several popular platforms. That is why I suggested to use proprietary transfer object (that is simple to implement and it won't be OS-specific), using it "capture" action would use to store image into clipboard and attachment dialog will be able to read it back.</thetext>

region screenshot

I implemented a function which helps to make a screenshot from an area of the screen.
It contains few problems yet (e.g: GC draw), so it's only a preview.

    <thetext>It sort of works, but there is way too many glitches and artifacts. I'd suggest to take a full window screenshot and then allow to crop it.

Also, picture shown on the screenshot capturing page is resized to fit window (imho, that is an arguable feature) and the worst part that it doesn't preserve the aspect ratio.</thetext>

I managed to move a file within the Package Explorer while trying to select the screenshot region. Eugene may have a point - perhaps taking a screenshot and allowing the user to crop would be easier and less error prone?

crop picture

I added a button which opens a dialog where you can modify the screenshot. 
I made 2 different versions. The first one (crop picture) is build on the original version, so it fits the image on the canvas. 
In the other version (crop picture aspect) I implemented a scrollcomposite, so the picture preserves the original size.
Sorry because I'm late, but my computer had a hardware problem, but it's working now.</thetext>

    <thetext>This is getting very slick Balazs. I think your first patch where you're scaling the screenshot to fit within the wizzard dialog is best. Less scroll bars the better!  Would it be possible to do the crop selection in place vs opening the additional window?  I can envision the following buttons on the create screenshot page:

[Capture] [Crop] [Revert]

User presses [Capture] and screenshot is shown as you have now.  Upon capture a message could appear above buttons (perhaps in wizard message area) stating "Drag selection on image to crop". Once user makes selection the [Crop] button becomes enabled. User presses [Crop] and cropped image is displayed. User can then crop again if they want. Upon pressing [Revert] (enabled after a crop has been performed) the original screenshot is restored in place.

Is this feasible?

    <thetext>Can we have an option to fit image to window (preserving the aspect ratio) or show it on the scroll panel?

Rob, we don't really need "Crop" and "Revert" buttons (less UI is better) and it will also eliminate issues like "cropped too much" that would usually require undo action. So, selected area should be picked up automatically and user should be able to change selection and then user could see result on the last wizard page (preview), which should be restored for the screenshot attachment.

Reopened issue, since we still have upcoming patches.</thetext>

crop picture v2

I made a new version. It contains a button which helps to switch between the "fit image" and the "aspect ratio keep" lookout.
This version does not contain the revert function, but I will attach this function too, then you can compare the two solution.
I added icons to the buttons (I will attach the icons as well). What do you think about this?</thetext>

    <thetext>Nice! It's great to have the option of fit vs 1:1 right within the same dialog. Have you given any thought to the notion of performing the crop within the same page? The buttons/icons are a good start and Mik will want to iterate on these. Also (as Eugene mentioned) less ui the better so if we can allow selection of the region to crop and just gray out what isn't contained within the cropped region this would eliminate the need for the crop button. Thoughts?</thetext>

    <thetext>&gt; Have you given any thought to the notion of performing the crop within the same page?
Yes. I tried it, but I don't like it. I have some problem with the GC. 
E.g: you select the section which you like to crop and you have the crop region border too. So if you make some modification on the page (scroll or change page with alt+tab) the region border will disappear.
&gt;  Also (as Eugene mentioned) less ui the better so if we can allow selection of the region to crop and just gray out what isn't contained within the cropped region this would eliminate the need for the crop button. 
Yes. It's a little bit crowded with this button. So I thought to move this button to the crop window. First when I tried to implement it, I put it to the crop window, but I had some refresh problem, then I moved it to the screenshot page and there it worked correctly, so I kept it.
For the gray coloring solution: I thought that too when I started it, but I did not start to implement it. I will try to implement this.

    <thetext>As per conference call lets update the fit image button to be a check box style button, change the Capture full screen button to simply read "Capture" and consider removing the crop button which is practically unnecessary but if we remove it we'll require some affordence to indicate the ability to crop by selection, perhaps changing the cursor when over the image?</thetext>

&gt; btw, had anyone thought about how to capture screenshots of the non Eclipse

I've been following this bug, but I haven't been trying out the work in progress.  I'm excited to see what you've come up with, but if it cannot capture screenshots outside of Eclipse, it does not handle my use case.

I would prefer that the effort had gone into fixing bug 78856 instead of developing a new user interface to solve a problem that I didn't have.  I have no trouble collecting a screenshot.  The existing user interface was completely intuitive, but the underlying functionality was missing.

I hope that both ways of getting a screenshot into a task will be available in the Eclipse 3.4 timeframe, when bug 78856 is hopefully resolved.</thetext>

Ken: I agree that it would be great to have bug 78856 fixed, and voted for that bug quite a while ago.  However, that bug involves low-level SWT and OS internals, and is not something that in scope for the Mylyn project.  Balazs is doing a great job of meeting the use case of allow users to capture screenshots of Eclipse to improve the feedback loop.  I realize that we have forked some from your original description of this bug is more generic that we will be able to do without a fix for bug 78856, so we should leave this one open until that's done, and I have created bug 200706 to track additional discussion not specific to the more generic support.  In the meantime, I suggest that you post a comment on bug 78856 asking if it is being considered for Eclipse 3.4.  You can also mention that Mylyn has gone as far as we can in supporting your request but cannot support generic clipboard capture without that fix.</thetext>

    <thetext>Remaining patch applied.  I had to make a fix to prevent invalid thread access due to cropping, and used more standard images for the icons (one from WTP one from the Platform).  Please look over the changes and make sure that all is to your liking.  Closing bug 200706.

This is fantastic stuff Balazs, and will be in the 2.1M1 New &amp; Noteworthy.

Regarding non-Eclipse windows, Balazs' current patch will allow you to capture those Windows as long as they are visible (verified on Vista only).  You just need to crop the capture accordingly.  If this is still lacking desicred functionality please reopen.</thetext>

    <thetext>It would be great to do some sort of highlighting for fields that caused problems during task submission. I think forms also has support setting warning icons for controls (similar to the content assist light bulb). We can consider that for a future version. Frank, it'd be great if you could file a new bug report and include the requirements, e.g. a mapping from attributes to controls.</thetext>

    <thetext>Does Frank's patch resolve the issue originally posed?  If so, I think we should close this bug and open another bugs for comments 4-8 :-)  Having the original issue solved fast would be terribly helpful to help users make sure they don't forget to fill in the component.

This has since been resolved and as you suggest I've created another bug to address highlighting the fields that were not completed (bug#249901).</thetext>

After solving my problems with SOAP::Lite I try to find out if the needed information are included.

But my knowledge of perl is not that perfect, so that could take some time.

    <thetext>Rob,

I did some test with Bugzilla 3.1.3 and found no way to get the value of the creationflag for custom attributes.

I think we must create a  enhancment that config.cgi returns the flag for custom attributes.

patch

This is the first Version.

Here the point that I think we should work on.

1) Code in NewBugzillaTaskEditor is duplicate of BugzillaTaskEditor
2) actually I did no tests with Bugzilla 3.1.3 only Bugzilla - Development was used
    (see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=429847)
3) The new included Custom Filed Types are currently not supported.

Here are a few nits that would be great if you could investigate and write up some unit test coverage for:

* Submission of multiselect is only submitting first selected item, (may be bug in multiselect editor part?)
* The date widet isn't getting updated, nor does submission work (looks like time format differences need to be accounted for)

    <thetext>Awesome Frank. My concern now is just with the changes that were necessary in DateAttributeEditor and TaskEditorAttributePart.  These changes were necessary to get time to display in the ui.  I wonder if this warrants a TaskAttribute.TYPE_DATETIME in addition to the existing TaskAttribute.TYPE_DATE type (and would simply extend the existing DateAttributeEditor but set show time to true?  

Steffen, does this sound reasonable to you?</thetext>

In TaskEditorSummaryPart.addAttribute the following lines can be removed after Jira, Trac and XPlanner have changed there implementation from TYPE_DATE to TYPE_TIMESTAMP

Looks like were done here Frank!  I just fixed up a few layout issues and eliminated a couple classes.  Steffen, if you could review the editor framework changes proposed here then we can commit if all is well!</thetext>

    <thetext>Looks good! Minor nit: The constructor of BugzillaCustomField could be simplified and the class should be made immutable.

I have extended LayoutHint so you should be able to use the copy constructor in BugzillaTaskEditorPage.createAttributeEditorFactory():

 editor.setLayoutHint(new LayoutHint(editor.getLayoutHint()) {
						@Override
						public int getPriority() {
							return super.getPriority() * 10;
						}
					});


I have created bug 253633 to track the API changes.</thetext>

    <thetext>Here is how you could refactor BugzillaCustomField to make it immutable:

	public BugzillaCustomField(String description, String name, String type, String typeDesc, String enterBug) {
		this.description = description;
		this.name = name;

		this.type = parseInt(type);
		this.typeDesc = typeDesc;
		this.enterBug = "1".equals(enterBug);
	}

	private int parseInt(String type) {
		try {
			return Integer.parseInt(type);
		} catch (NumberFormatException e) {
			return -1;
		}
	}
	
The patch is pretty big. It would probably make sense to split out the test case and create a separate bug for that.</thetext>

update without tests

Updated patch with changes suggested and removed tests. Frank, if you want to post those to a separate report that would be great. I can apply this patch as is.  Steffen, note I had to set layout hints for in the constructor of the DateAttributeEditor and TextAttributeEditor. Shouldn't be any nagative side effects.</thetext>

    <thetext>Generally, is it necessary to store the version in the repository settings? If it is available from the configuration is seems that the client could get it whenever needed. Would it make sense to add an "Auto" setting so the user would not have to worry and validation would not have to download the entire configuration?</thetext>

&gt; Generally, is it necessary to store the version in the repository settings? If

&gt; whenever needed. Would it make sense to add an "Auto" setting so the user would

Makes sense to me, this should be feasible now.</thetext>

correction for new patch

Sorry if the version is set to "Automatic (use Validate Settings)"we can not use the cached configuration

(In reply to comment #5)
&gt; (In reply to comment #4)
&gt; &gt; Generally, is it necessary to store the version in the repository settings? If
&gt; &gt; it is available from the configuration is seems that the client could get it
&gt; &gt; whenever needed. Would it make sense to add an "Auto" setting so the user would
&gt; &gt; not have to worry and validation would not have to download the entire
&gt; &gt; configuration?
&gt; 
&gt; Makes sense to me, this should be feasible now.
&gt; 

This is allready implemented but did not work because the repositoryconfiguration is null so the version did not get set.</thetext>

    <thetext>I see what you mean Frank, but I think Steffen was getting at a deaper issue here - that we in fact don't need to retrieve the configuration at all to validate. 
Unless there is a good use case I'm unaware of, I propose we eliminate the option to set the repository version (we can just put a lable somewhere, maybe message area, indicating the range of Bugzilla versions supported).  Since, at a later stage, the configuraiton will be retrieved anyway and will contain the server version, we can always retrieve it then.

Does this ring true to you Frank?

Steffen, do you have any reservations about removing this from the ui completely?</thetext>

new patch

(In reply to comment #10)
&gt; I see what you mean Frank, but I think Steffen was getting at a deaper issue
&gt; here - that we in fact don't need to retrieve the configuration at all to
&gt; validate. 
The new patch only reads the configuration if the version was set to Automatic in the UI.
&gt; Unless there is a good use case I'm unaware of, I propose we eliminate the
&gt; option to set the repository version (we can just put a lable somewhere, maybe
&gt; message area, indicating the range of Bugzilla versions supported).  Since, at
&gt; a later stage, the configuraiton will be retrieved anyway and will contain the
&gt; server version, we can always retrieve it then.
&gt; 
&gt; Does this ring true to you Frank?
&gt; 
&gt; Steffen, do you have any reservations about removing this from the ui
&gt; completely?
&gt; 

There is only one disadvantage with this. You can no longer fake the UI if you did not have installed the right version of bugzilla (see bug#197539). Instead I can change RepositoryConfiguration.getInstallVersion() to get the same result.</thetext>

    <thetext>Looks like the only two instances of the version being used are for adding operations and adding line wrapping.  In both cases if null, we just default to 2.18.  So lets just proceed with eliminating this from the configuration ui and from the validation mechanism. Its true that you will not be able to fake out the client but there doesn't seem to be much value in that. So unless I'm missing something Frank, just go ahead eliminate it.</thetext>

Yes, I can look at this. But I think that we should make the "Assigned to :" field editable.

patch

Bugzilla 3.2 is the first Version that use a new way to set the status.

This patch has only a fix for the old workflow. I think we need some more information (Bug Status Workflow) in the config to come up with a better way to support the new workflow.</thetext>

    <thetext>Okay thanks for looking into this Frank.  Could you put together a unit test for this that state changes works for both 3.2 and earlier version (i.e. 2.22)?

Regarding further improvements, I'll have to look into the new workflow in 3.2 and see what can be done. </thetext>

&gt; Okay thanks for looking into this Frank.  Could you put together a unit test
&gt; for this that state changes works for both 3.2 and earlier version (i.e. 2.22)?
Can you point me to a junit test where a new task is created. If I have this I can create a junit that set all states .
&gt; 
&gt; Regarding further improvements, I'll have to look into the new workflow in 3.2
&gt; and see what can be done. 
I think we need an enhancement for get the information from /editworkflow.cgi in the /config.cgi?ctype=rdf before we can support this in Mylyn.

    <thetext>Any UI suggestions for this?

We could add another wizard page for attachment creation, but that makes 4 with the preview page. (Though this one and the preview are both optional)

An alternative would be to add a table to the attachment details page where users could select attachments which are depricated. This would make the whole dialog larger.</thetext>

    <thetext>How about just adding a context menu action to attachments called "Mark Obsolete"?  It varies from the Bugzilla interaction, but I think that it is more obvious, easier to implement, and needs to be there anyway.  Then if enough people complain we can add a table to the wizard page.</thetext>

    <thetext>We could make it immediate to be in line with the way that uploading attachments work. However we should establish what is immediate and what is not or users might start getting confused. If I change the priority and bug ownership, its not updated until I hit submit. If I add an attachment or mark one obsolete, it updates immediately... There is a natural reason why w.r.t bugzilla (each of those is its own transaction) but that isn't necessarily obvious to the user.


Un-obsolete is doable as well.</thetext>

    <thetext>Excellent point, we need to draw a clear line and I'm probably blurring it too much.  Our current or example, we may want to enable priority setting for repository tasks via the task list, and those should take place immediately.

For now I'm tempted to keep with the eclipse.org convention that everything in the editor does not take effect until it is 'saved', which in our case is a combo of save and submit (e.g. direct actions can only be done via the task list or via a wizard, which is in line with conventions).  So maybe the best thing for you to do for now is to create a page for deprecating patches, and  pop up that single page if "Mark Obsolete" is clicked??</thetext>

    <thetext>Hmm. On a second though, wouldn't it make sense to make all the changes without submission and submit everything at once when user hit Submit button? That should include attachments as well. But attachments should immediately appear in the attachments table once they added.

It may also make sense to add an "Obsolete" column with checkboxes that user can uncheck to mark attachments obsolete...</thetext>

    <thetext>We'll have to discuss this further before deciding, and should wait for Rob since he has spent a lot of time thinking about the editor interaction.

Jeff: for now just stick with the current interaction and put the deprecation functionality into the wizard, since it will most likely always be needed there.

Heh. It would of saved time if that would be done in the attachment table right in the editor. Even if those changes are not submitted immediately... Note that it would also allowed to obsolete existing patches without submitting a new one.</thetext>

    <thetext>The IAttachmentHandler API doesn't support a way to depricate patches. How should we handle this? I've implemented everything to be generic in the tasks namespace so far, maybe this should be bugzilla specific? The RepositoryAttachment class has an isObsolete() method so it seems the concept of obsolete attachments is generic to all repo types, perhaps an obsoleteAttachment() method should be added to the IAttachmentHandler instead of making this bugzilla specific.

    <thetext>Since other attributes may change, perhaps we need a more generic method like updateAttachment(...)? That way we don't have methods for each attribute that may change.</thetext>

    <thetext>Just a thought: we are now discussing about the applicability of the "attachment deprecation" on connectors other than bugzilla.

In fact, there may be other capabilities who are applicable to bugzilla but not in other connector(s), and vice-versa.

The problem here is to define a stable interface not tied to any specific repository connector.

I didn't take a look on the connector architecture used in Mylar, but I presume it is actually based on a interface hierarchy implemented by concrete connectors.

Have you considered adopting a adapter-based architecture like in ECF Container's model?

This way there can be a number of interfaces defining "capabilities" that a connector can have, and each connector implements the interfaces for the capabilities it supports.

In this model, if you want to know if a connector X supports a capability Y, all you have to do is ask it for the corresponding interface via IAdapterManager.

Of course, maybe this can be a complex solution to this specific issue, but it is something that we can face when considering how to evolve the connector architecture in a flexible way.

Just my 0,02 cents...</thetext>

    <thetext>The UI components are in place in the wizard (it will be easy enough to add operations to the context menu of the attachment table too if needed). I've filed bug 153788 to track the issue of creating generic API to allow depricating (and other generic operations) on repository attachments.</thetext>

He he.  OK, so I got 90% through this (bug 103932) but couldn't make the Apply Patch wizard read in the patch when it was written to a temporary file outside of the workspace.  I may be able to give it a little more time this week but not much.  I pinged Jeff to see if he was interested in helping out on it but no reply.

    <thetext>I think "deprecate" action need to be added to the popup menu for the attachment table created in AbstractRepositoryTaskEditor.createAttachmentLayout(). Action would call AbstractAttachmentHandler.updateAttachment() which should delegate to new method in BugzillaCleint which would update attachment status.

New test case could go into BugzillaRepositoryConnectorTest, which already have one testcase for attachment reading or into the new test class for BugzillaAttachmentHandler.</thetext>

    <thetext>On this point of deprecating attachments, maybe this should be made more generic to allow for deletion as well.  Many repositories allow for deletion of attachments, where I see deprecation as more of a bugzilla-centric operation.  Is this feasible to add?

    <thetext>When moving some bug to another product, it is common to forget to change the assignee, because the "move to another product" story involves many other changes:

- Change the product.
- Change the component.
- Change the version.

It just happened on bug#218412 where it got moved to SWT, but Mik forgot to change the assignee to SWT inbox. I remember having got into this problem myself too at least 1 time.

Another side problem I see is that the assignee field auto-completion does not suggest the inbox accounts.</thetext>

Patch

To get this work I must change radios in AbstractRepositoryTaskEditor from private to protected AbstractRepositoryTaskEditor.

Only the following is supported.
- Change the product.
- Change the component.

The version change is not included because I did not see that this results in an other assignee.</thetext>

&gt; Frank, it looks like the patch went stale with editor refactoring for Mylyn 3.0.
&gt; Please consider the necessary changes as part of bug 166595.

Bug# 166595 is now resolved I think that we can close this bug to.</thetext>

    <thetext>Agreed. Although one of the original requests was to move the bug to the default component assignee, I don't think we should be automating that (since it may just as easily not be intended) and assigning to default is available as an action.  What is the consensus on this?</thetext>

    <thetext>BugzillaClient uses String comparison to determine if the server has a certain release or higher installed:

 String bugzillaVersion = repositoryConfiguration.getInstallVersion();
 if (bugzillaVersion.compareTo("2.18") &lt; 0) {
  ...
 }
 
This is not robust for versions &gt; 10, e.g. 2.18 &lt; 2.2 although was released in 1999 and 2.18 in 2005. JiraVersion has an implementation that compares version numbers by segment.</thetext>

    <thetext>A connector may wish to report the status of a task submission.  For example, the Bugzilla Web UI reports who was notified of the change to the bug (bug 165072).

    <thetext>Frank, we need to work out a general solution for post task submission work flow, which ties directly into what you have done here. This needs to be taken into account along with the other work being done on bug#179254.  Steffen and I will need to review this together so are unfortunately blocking on this at the moment while other work is completed. Once this is done we can integrate your patch. </thetext>

    <thetext>I have changed the API in AbstractTaskDataHandler2 to return an object of type RepositoryResponse (see bug 194570). Connectors can extend that type to return a custom response from the repository. This response object will be available to the editor.

Frank, this is similar to the proposed change in your patch. Please check if the new API is suitable for your requirements. Please note that the new API is not used at the moment and will require porting of the Bugzilla connector to the new task data / editor architecture </thetext>

&gt; RepositoryResponse (see bug 194570). Connectors can extend that type to return a
&gt; custom response from the repository. This response object will be available to

Did you think that a Connector like Bugzilla should subclass RepositoryResponse. If so I think it is better to rename this class to AbstractRepositoryResponse .
&gt; 
&gt; Frank, this is similar to the proposed change in your patch. Please check if the
&gt; new API is suitable for your requirements.
I think that this is a good base for doing the extensions that we need for email addresses or Content proposals.
&gt; Please note that the new API is not
&gt; used at the moment and will require porting of the Bugzilla connector to the new
&gt; task data / editor architecture
Is there an other bug that I can watch so that I know when I can start.
Or do you think that we do this within this bug.
Is this your task or do you think that I should take this?

My sense is that most connector won't have a need to extend the class. The framework currently only uses two different responses: "task created" and "task updated". This will be sufficient for JIRA and Trac as other cases are error cases and will be indicated by an exception.

Great. We can still extend / change the API based on requirements for Bugzilla.

&gt; &gt; used at the moment and will require porting of the Bugzilla connector to the
&gt; new

I am not sure if there is a bug, yet. Rob as the maintainer of the Bugzilla component will be managing any porting. I am currently using the JIRA connector as the driver for the API refactorings. To track progress it is best to create a query for all bugs that contain"[api]" in the summary and that are scheduled for the "3.0" milestone. Getting these bugs fixed is currently our highest priority and all api changes/enhancements are tracked on those bugs.

Frank, I am reassigning this bug to you since there is still an open patch attached that extends Bugzilla's error handling. </thetext>

    <thetext>Part of me it seems relevant for the sake of completeness, since it is something that the Web UI offers, and is useful for know when someone is watching bugs.  However, it partly goes against the normal mode of working in Mylyn, which does not rely on email notifications.

In terms of UI, one thing I can imagine us doing with it is having an Info message that says "Submitted..." and then a tooltip that shows all the email addresses notified of the change.</thetext>

    <thetext>Frank, could you port your patch to the current head and change your implementation to extend RepositoryResponse in a Bugzilla specific way, i.e. create a subclass in the Bugzilla core plug-in that has additional fields?

We can then discuss ways to make the result of the task submit job available to the task editor.</thetext>

    <thetext>Disregard my last comment, I just realized that this has already been implemented on bug 168204.

How about this: We add a new method to the task editor page which is invoked after a submit, e.g.:

 protected void taskSubmitted(SubmitJobEvent event);
 
The event object would provide access to the details, i.e. the status of the submit job and RepositoryResponse object. The Bugzilla task editor page could override the method and handle the result accordingly.

Frank, would that suffice to implement bug 165072 and bug 168204?</thetext>

Steffen,

is it OK that I do this in the following way
1) update the patch for bug 168204 and create the SubmitJobEvent
2) do this bug 
3) go to create a patch for 165072

What is the timeframe to get this done and reach the 3.2 version? If time is to short can you take over one or more steps?

&gt; 2) do this bug
&gt; 3) go to create a patch for 165072

That sounds good. I have attached a patch to this bug with the proposed API. When working on the other bugs you can assume that this API exists but I don't want to commit it until we know it is sufficient. Note that there is one outstanding problem that needs to be fixed when a new bug is submitted: The handleTaskSubmitted() method should be invoked on the newly created editor in that case.

&gt; What is the timeframe to get this done and reach the 3.2 version? If time is to
&gt; short can you take over one or more steps?

My list for 3.2 is already overloaded so I probably won't have time. It would be great if we had a first working version of the user match mode support by 3.2M2 (May 15th) which would give us some time to review and work out any problems.

In case that is not enough time you could consider prioritizing bug 165072 which is less valuable but might be simpler to tackle.

Rob, I can try to make this. But please point me to the right place for start.

I don't know what class you meen with "old system uses properties" and what is the place where I replace them with the configuration.</thetext>

See the landmarks in this context Frank. Essentially setting/getting of values in these two methods needs to be eradicated and values retrieved from the repository configuration directly.  Note that we want to retain the ability to force an update of the attributes (so update button remains).</thetext>

http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn_Contributor_Reference#Setup is not correct.
org.eclipse.mylyn/sandbox is not valid.

I download your patch and did a textual compare and think  it is OK.

&gt; We have all the information needed to move bugs across components
for components within the same product this already implemented or did you mean something different?
&gt;, and to
&gt; support creation of bugs without forcing the user to select a component in the
&gt; wizard (bug 244553).
Should this mean that we define an default Product/Component and let the user change that Product/Component after creation?
&gt;  It is also the biggest chunk of Bugzilla functionality
&gt; missing from the rich editor.
Please give me some more information and I look what can be done here.

Sorry, I meant products!  I updated the summary accordingly.

&gt; Should this mean that we define an default Product/Component and let the user
&gt; change that Product/Component after creation?

I figure that the simplest way to make this happen is the following, since it avoids forcing the user to have to deal with an extra wizard page/dialog, which is effectively what the Bugzilla Web UI does.
1) User changes the Product attribute, causing the task editor to make the values of the attributes that no longer match be blank (Component and Target milestone).
2) User cannot submit the task editor until those values are selected, similar to how they currently cannot submit a new task editor without selecting the product.

How does that sound?</thetext>

OK, now I think I can create a patch for this.
Is this OK that I start this after 3.0.2 is released?</thetext>

    <thetext>Hello,

since we are about to migrate from our self made bug tracker accessed by the Generic Web Connector to a Trac system, I wonder how far this bug has been progressed. Will it be possible to move bugs from the Generic Web connector to Trac using Mylyn? This would be really great stuff!

Looking forward to see this in one of the next weekly builds?

Thanks, Jörg</thetext>

    <thetext>This bug is specific to the Bugzilla connector for moving bugs across products within a sinlge Bugzilla repository.

 Mylyn currently does not have built-in functionality for migrating bugs between repositories but this could be implemented based on the tasks core API. Joerg, please file a separate bug for that detailing your use case.</thetext>

    <thetext>Given the current plan providing a mapping between data model and UI elements is probably not going to make it into 3.2. Here is how I could see this getting implemented for Bugzilla in time for 3.1:

Track the mapping between task attributes and attribute editors in the factory created by BugzillaTaskEditorPage.createAttributeEditorFactory().

 Register a listener using BugzillaTaskEditorPage.getModel().addModelListener() that gets notified when a product is selected. Update other attributes (component, versions, milestone) accordingly and refresh the UI. This would require AbstractTaskEditorPart to implement refresh() and a similar method on AbstractAttributeEditor. 
 
Frank, as a first cut we could implement the Bugzilla portion and the UI refresh for TaskEditorAttributePart and SingleSelectionAttributeEditor. That should be sufficient to resolve this bug and we can then consider applying the same change to other attribute editors and moving more of the functionality into the framework. Would you be interested in taking a pass at this?

    <thetext>Frank, I'll be applying your current patch but to the new task editor only to implement bug#244553. 

Would you be willing to investigate a workaround to the problem of Bugzilla always asking to verify the details upon moving an *existing* bug to another product.  For example, if upon posting the task data we get back the verify page, we could immediately post (all from within the client) the information we already have from the task data.  

Also, if you could file a bug against bugzilla.org requesting that if valid data is passed (i.e. for version) when moving products that they simply return the standard 'Changes submitted' page.</thetext>

My oldest version is 3.0.4 and there this field is also included.

Works great! Minor updates:

* removed a method in BugzillaTaskEditorPage and reduced visibility of others

Frank if you could do a sanity check on these changes that would be great. You may be able to eliminate some duplicate code in the ProductSelectionListener?

    <thetext>A server side work around that can be applied is to comment out the following code from buglist.cgi. Webmaster has been informed.

#
# If query was POSTed, clean the URL from empty parameters and redirect back to
# itself. This will make advanced search URLs more tolerable.
#
if ($cgi-&gt;request_method() eq 'POST') {
    $cgi-&gt;clean_search_url();

    print $cgi-&gt;redirect(-url =&gt; $cgi-&gt;self_url());
    exit;
}

I will post a patch shortly that resolves this multiple task retrieval issue then look into the timezone related incoming problem.</thetext>

    <thetext>Problem: Bugzilla versions &lt; 3.4 (?) included a hard-coded time zone or no time zone information at all in the last modification date. Newer version support a user configurable time zone and format the time stamp accordingly. This can cause false incomings since time stamps are currently compared as strings.

Suggestion for migration of last modified time stamp:
1. Detect if modification date is a new time stamp

2a) old time stamp exits, repository uses old format
3. Compare by string

2b) old time stamp exits, repository now uses new format
3. Parse old time stamp as date
4. Compare old and new time stamps: assume no change if difference between old time and new time is an exact multiplier of 1 hour and in the range of +/- 24h
5. Store new time stamp in new attribute, remove old time stamp (how will that affect backwards compatibility?)

2c) new time stamp exits
3. Compare by date</thetext>

    <thetext>Turns out that when a query is executed a redirect is now happening on the server which can result in a truncated request for large queries: When Mylyn makes a POST request for all changed bugs, the size of the request can exceed 8k. Bugzilla sanitizes the request and redirects to the result page using a url that is truncated to 8k. Since the parameters are stored in a map, the resulting url can consist of random portions of the original request sometimes resulting in the date range that is specified in the query getting dropped. In that case Bugzilla returns all queried tasks as changed.

If the following snippet is removed from buglist.cgi the redirect does not happen and the search will go through unaltered (and make queries faster, only requiring a single round trip):

bc.. 
#
# If query was POSTed, clean the URL from empty parameters and redirect back to
# itself. This will make advanced search URLs more tolerable.
#
if ($cgi-&gt;request_method() eq 'POST') {
    $cgi-&gt;clean_search_url();

    print $cgi-&gt;redirect(-url =&gt; $cgi-&gt;self_url());
    exit;

    <thetext>The Mylyn 3.2.2 release is planned for SR1 on September 25th. Will you update the Fedora packages based on the Galileo SR1? I think that would be sufficient as only users with &gt;1000 tasks in their task list will run into this problem.</thetext>

&gt; The Mylyn 3.2.2 release is planned for SR1 on September 25th. Will you update
&gt; the Fedora packages based on the Galileo SR1? I think that would be sufficient
&gt; as only users with &gt;1000 tasks in their task list will run into this problem.

Yes, I'm planning on updating to SR1.  Thanks, Steffen.</thetext>

    <thetext>With user customizable time zones now in Bugzilla, we can no longer rely on string comparison (for Bugzilla 3.4 and greater). We need to detect and use the timezone if available as per Steffen suggested approach on bug#288175 comment#4:

Problem: Bugzilla versions &lt; 3.4 (?) included a hard-coded time zone or no time
zone information at all in the last modification date. Newer version support a
user configurable time zone and format the time stamp accordingly. This can
cause false incomings since time stamps are currently compared as strings.

Suggestion for migration of last modified time stamp:
1. Detect if modification date is a new time stamp

2a) old time stamp exits, repository uses old format
3. Compare by string

2b) old time stamp exits, repository now uses new format
3. Parse old time stamp as date
4. Compare old and new time stamps: assume no change if difference between old
time and new time is an exact multiplier of 1 hour and in the range of +/- 24h
5. Store new time stamp in new attribute, remove old time stamp (how will that
affect backwards compatibility?)

2c) new time stamp exits
3. Compare by date</thetext>

    <thetext>Patch looks good. Only minor nit I noticed is this chunk of code:

+				if (queryDate == null) {
+						event.setData(bCollector.getQueryTimestamp());

If we can't parse the date, wouldn't it be better to revert to the old strategy that checks task time stamps?</thetext>

The idea is the following: The BugzillaFixture class provide static field for accessing to instances of BugzillaFixture that provide access to the various test configurations. Test cases can obtain the currently active fixture by invoking BugzillaFixture.current() and should run tests against that particular repository configuration.

The AllBugzillaTestSuite generates tests suites that run the same set of tests multiple times against different configurations by activating  a different fixture (i.e. changing the result of BugzillaFixture.current()) each a suite is run.

I have converted and moved a few tests to a new core package in the tests plug-in. The tests are currently failing since they expect certain bugs to be present in the repository which do not exist, yet. We are currently in the process of figuring out how much initial setup (custom fields, products etc.) we should have in the database schema to make this work. Once that has been decided and the repositories have been initialized the core tests should be made passing again and then the remaining tests need to be refactored. In the end we'll hopefully have a test suite that is more portable, easier to adopt for new versions of Bugzilla and less fragile when bugs change in the test repository.

Thomas, can you post what you have determined so far in terms of requirements for the database setup?</thetext>

    <thetext>Here are the failing tests and some reason why they are currently failing:

*AllBugzillaHeadlessStandaloneTests*, *BugzillaTaskDataHandlerTest*, *BugzillaRepositoryConnectorStandaloneTest*, *RepositoryReportFactoryTest*, *BugzillaSearchTest*, *BugzillaRepositoryConnectorTest*, *EncodingTest*, *BugzillaDateTimeTests*
tests do not need anything special set up besides the 3 users.
However all 9 failing tests in that suite need some tweaking so they put whatever they want to test against into the repository first (and clean up afterwards)

*TaskEditorTest*
This one should not be a bugzilla test in the first place.

*BugzillaSearchPageTest*
Failing on it's own, without the repository playing a part

*BugzillaRepository32Test*
Needs custom fields:
* cf_colors {multi select} with allowed values: Red, Green, Yellow, Blue
* some more custom fields are needed by testCustomAttributesNewTask, but that seems redundant, I think using cf_colors in that test should be enough
Still needs work to actually create the bugs in the state it needs them.</thetext>

    <thetext>It seems in terms of db structure, not a lot is needed.
All tests test against the on-default created TestProduct/TestComponent. I think we should create at least 2 versions and 2 milestones just to have them around. Besides that, a custom field called "cf_colors", being a multi-select combo with values {Blue, Green, Yellow, Red} is necessary. Finally three users should be set up: admin/tests/guest (and for guest the group-regex for the editbugs group needs to be removed).
The custom fields are required for Bugzilla 3.2 and above.

Since we figured that we cannot automate the DB setup, we should see that everything we need is in there on the first setup to limit manual tweaks. So Steffen, Rob, any other things we might want to test against any time soon? Things that come to mind are: other custom field types, other products/components (to test switching those).

As soon as we have determined the initial set, I can set up clean DBs, make dumps for each bugzilla version and come up with a script that removes the existing DB and replaces it with a DB created from that dump.

If we would need additional setup work done, all the dumps affected need to be updated.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks for posting the list! Sounds like we should create a schema that supports the set of available types and options for custom fields: http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/tip/en/html/custom-fields.html .

Other setup that we discussed:
- 3 Products
- 2 Milestones
- 2 Versions
- Custom Fields of all available types
- 2 Flags
- 2 Keywords
- Users: Admin, Guest, User

For now 3.0.8, 3.2.4 and 3.4.1 are most important and we can worry about the other versions later.

Once the repository setup is complete the goal is to get the tests in the core package passing again.</thetext>

    <thetext>Alright, here is the initial setup for the database as agreed on:

* admin@mylyn.eclipse.org
* tests@mylyn.eclipse.org
* guest@mylyn.eclipse.org
* 2 additional products
* have 2 components in each of the products
* handful of versions for each
* handful of milestones for each
* two flags fo bugs
* two flags for attachments
* one custom_field of each type
** with, if applicable, a handful of allowed values
** the multi select combo be called cf_color with {Red, Yellow, Green, Blue}
* two keywords</thetext>

patch v1

Here are changes that make the headless pass for all but:

*2.18.6:* in many ways, I would say: ignore this

*3.2.3 &amp; 3.2.2:* for some strange reason the configuration does not contain the milestones. The XML file does, and it looks exactly like the 3.2.4 XML file (which passes). usetargetmilestones was disabled for those repositories, but I enabled it. Not sure what is going on there....maybe someone else can try reproducing this.

So besides the weird 3.2.2/3.2.3 issue this should be fine. I added some tweaks to the test fixture classes, and removed usage of TasksUiPlugin as well as BugzillaCorePlugin instances. For headless tests the connector should be retrieved from the BugzillaFixture directly (using .connector()).

Also I needed to make on method public for testing and add a check to the initializeTaskData to make it work in a headless environment.</thetext>

patch v2

this patch removes 2.18.6, 3.22 and 3.2.3 from the Fixture, and all Tests pass

Since we have the latest 3.2.x still in the fixture, this should be fine.</thetext>

    <thetext>Great! Thanks Thomas. I think that we should take a look at the cyclic dependency between BugzillaCorePlugin and BugzillaRepositoryConnector and consider cleaning that up instead of keeping instances in sync in tests. Let's look over the code sometime today.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks Thomas! I have committed the patch and opened bug 289663 to track refactoring the circular dependency between BugzillaCorePlugin and BugzillaRepositoryConnector.

I made a few minor modifications to make tests in BugzillaRepositoryConnectorStandaloneTest slightly more readable: 
* Only factor things that are common to all tests, e.g. only create a task in setup() if it's used by all tests. That avoids slowing down tests and could also cause unrelated failures of tests.
* Avoid if (foo.equals(bar)) ... else fail(); constructs. It's better to simply assert the condition assertEquals(foo, bar); ...
* Avoid loops in tests. Loops make it difficult to figure out why a test failed if it does.</thetext>

Doing a Task search and restricting the query with "comment" doesn't work with bugzilla 3.4 (eclipse bugzilla).
When I select a product and a component, the search result always contains all tasks instead of only the tasks that match with my "comment" query.</thetext>

work around for bugzilla bug

In 3.4.1 Bugzilla's query page now uses a different identifier for the comment.  They still use the correct standard one in the xml.  This patch will construct the correct url given the repository version and any existing old format queries will be adapted upon execution to the new format if the repo is &gt;= 3.4.1</thetext>

other way for a patch

(In reply to comment #7)
&gt; Created an attachment (id=147025)
&gt; updated patch
&gt; 
&gt; Yes. Works fine if both long_desc and longdesc are used in the query for 3.0
&gt; and 3.4.1

Rob, Steffen

I implement an other way to fix this. Now we only create long_decs for Bugzilla &lt; 3.4 or longdesc for Bugzilla &gt;= 3.4.

This way we can find that code when we remove support for 3.2.

I think we should apply this in HEAD.

Thoughts?</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks Frank. That approach is similar to Rob's original patch and I can see how that is more efficient since the search string is only sent ince. The reason we changed it to sending longdesc and long_desc is to handle these cases:

* If the repository configuration is stale the version may not be detected correctly and a search would return wrong results.
* If Bugzilla decides to "fix" this in the future and reverts back to long_desc older Mylyn clients would be broken. 

I'm in favor of keeping the current implementation. I'll reopen this bug for discussion. Rob, has a bug against Bugzilla been filed to clarify why the field was renamed?</thetext>

Thanks for investigating this Frank but I think we should stick with the current patch. I've submitted a bug against bugzilla.org for what is essentially an api breakage:

    <thetext>The bugzilla connector treats the statuses RESOLVED, VERIFIED and CLOSED as complete and all others as incomplete. 

Bugzilla allows the introduction of custom states with an attribute whether such a custom state should be regarded as open or completed. In our company we use an additional state "APPROVED" which we like to regard as one of the completed states. 

The attached patch replaces the hard coded values with information from the configuration to check whether a task is completed.

Perhaps, this bug has a relation to bug 189788.</thetext>

    <thetext>This patch looks good, but  could you please do the following changes.

1) add an field closeStateValues to RepositoryConfiguration with the two methods getClosedStatusValues() and addClosedStatusValue(String value)

2) change SaxConfigurationContentHandler.endElement to use addClosedStatusValue (TODO in line 300)

3) change your patch that it use getClosedStatusValues() instead of getOpenStatusValues()

    <thetext>We have a potential in a race condition here since it hinges on if we send back the timezone in the date stamp. We currently strip this information in order to avoid mid-air collisions since the server doesn't accept this date format. The proposed changes to the bugzilla server would in fact require the timezone.  We could add a bugzilla version check and only strip the time zone if the repository is &lt; 3.4.x but of course if the fix doesn't make it into bugzilla, or if an alternate solution is taken we'll have a problem.</thetext>

    <thetext>Yes, lets consider the Bugzilla component locked until we have these tests passing.

BugzillaTaskHyperlinkDetectorTest - Frank could you investigates since you've been working on link detection improvements.
   
BugzillaRepositoryConnectorTest - I'll look into getting time tracking enabled in the configuration for the test servers.

BugzillaRepository32Test - Frank, another one for you. I'll commit what porting I've done then if you could look at the failing tests that would be great.

BugzillaDateTimeTests - I'll take a look at this.</thetext>

    <thetext>The last build failed with the error which could be related to our local test server setup being outdated. Frank, Rob, please let me know if I need to make any changes to the test server to fix any of these failures.

It also looks like AllBugzillaTests does not actually run tests against multiple repository configurations like AllBugzillaHeadlessStandaloneTests does. Can you change AllBugzillaTests to follow the same pattern of creating nested test suites to run relevant tests against all fixtures?

    <thetext>I have exported the databases from mylyn.eclipse.org and imported them on the test server. Rob, please check the results of the last test run, there are 33 failures.

We should also do the following:
* Go through all of the test classes and figure out which need to run against different repository configuration (e.g. it's sufficient to run BugzillaSearchPageTest once outside of the fixture suites since it doesn't do anything repository specific).
* Add version check or modify the fixture suite setup to exclude tests that are not compatible with older Bugzilla versions (e.g. when testing custom fields).
* Remove all init..() methods in AbstractBugzillaTest and replace them by usage of the fixture.
* Remove Bugzilla 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 specific tests as 3.2.4 and later are the only supported versions in the 3.2.x stream now.</thetext>

    <thetext>I saw that you have disabled all tests that were previously running against Bugzilla &lt; 3.0. While we don't officially support those versions anymore wouldn't it make sense to run a very basic set of tests against them? We already have the setup in place and know that most tests were passing. Don't bother with it if you think the cost of maintaining these tests is too high in the end.</thetext>

&gt; 3.3.x maintenance stream?

To summarize the fix, there was a bug in how the html responses were parsed in the client. When parsing responses the title element is checked for success/failure. In a few places, the code looked for the title, then if it didn't find a successful indicator, the stream was reset and passed along to another function to be rescanned for error cases.  Some of the response pages now appear to have more content in the header resulting in the marker being overrun and the reset subsequently failing. This was leading to the second parse missing the &lt;title&gt; element completely.  The response parsing has now been consolidated and now only performs a single parse without the need of markers. So there was some refactoring involved but given some mileage backporting should be feasible.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks Rob. Great that you applied that refactoring and fixed the bug. It sounds like the changes were significant so I think we are better off disabling the failing tests in 3.3.x branch. There is only one week to the release and backporting the amount of changes would add some overhead and introduce too high of a risk of regressions.</thetext>

    <thetext>In Bugzilla 3.6:
* The default list of values for the Priority field are now clear English words instead of P1, P2, etc.

The list is now: {Highest, High, Normal, Low, Lowest} instead of {P1, P2, P3, P4, P5}.

The method PriorityLevel.fromString() currently always returns P3 when it is sent a value from the above list, thus all Bugzilla tasks in a 3.6 Bugzilla instance are P3s.  PriorityLevel.fromString() should be altered to return the correct level for these new default values.</thetext>

    <thetext>Yesterday I noticed that all my tasks have priority P3 when hovering over the tasklist and in the icon displayed in the task editor (to the
left of the title). This was definitely not the case when I was using the older version in ganemeade.

I tried to update the repository configuration (Task Repositories view &gt; Popup Menu &gt; Update 
Repository Configuration) and to re-sync my tasks.

Furthermore, I then tried to delete and recreate the task repository and I also tried a
new workspace all to no success: The priorities of our bugzilla seem not
to be mapped to the mylyn priorities.

We use a 3.6 bugzilla with the default priorities (P1 to P5).</thetext>

    <bug_when>2010-07-23 05:53:22 -0400</bug_when>
    <thetext>The reason for our problem was this:
- Bugzilla 3.6 ships with priorities "Highest", "High", ... instead of "P1", "P2", ...
- The Mylyn Bugzilla connector has mappings for priorities hard coded. If Bugzilla version is &gt;= 3.6 it expects "High" and not "P2"

Our bugzilla installation was just updated to 3.6 and therefore kept the old "P1" priorities. After my update to the newest Mylyn it seemed as though as the tasks have lost their priorities.

The good news is that it is possible (and easy) to update the priority field values in bugzilla. After setting them to the expected values mylyn works again as expected.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks for the detailed explanation, Peter. Sorry for closing this bug prematurely. It's a very common scenario that Bugzilla repositories are migrated, so it seems likely that priority levels would be P1 - P5 even in version 3.6 and later.</thetext>

    <thetext> (In reply to comment #20)
&gt; This might be fixed in this evening's weekly build along with some other refresh
&gt; problems.  Please try it.
What I want to happen is this:
- I select the query
- I do Mark as Read
+ all tasks, including subtasks, should be marked read and the incoming should disappear

What happens with the latest version is this
+ all direct included tasks are marked read, but not the subtasks
+ incoming marker does not disappear

Also I find that when then manually marking all subtasks as read:
- the incoming indicator disappears in expanded view but
- it remains in collapsed view! Very strange! This is clearly a bug!

Also 2: a cannot select the archive category and do a marked as read for that, the menu option just doesn't show.

I suspect that is has to do with improper handling of 'overlapping queries'. i.e. several queries that each select the same task.
I.e. the second query checking itself doesn't find any incoming (as these are changed by the previous one) so it lazily doesn't change its presentation, while it should change to no incoming.</thetext>

    <thetext>2nd thing noticed is that query shows no incoming changes when a closed task has an incoming change. I believe this should only be the case when closed tasks are filtered out. If not- updates should be shown according to the tasks displayed (at least as long as all tasks for a query are shown). Otherwise query decorator and tasks decorators are not in sync.</thetext>

- show "incoming changes indicator" when unexpanded

&gt; - show "incoming changes indicator" when unexpanded
&gt; - don't show the "incoming changes indicator" when expanded
Robert,

I now think it may not be a bug in the marking code but behavior that is nonintuitive to some.
When the query is expanded the task with incoming itself becomes visible, AND therefor the marker is dropped from the parent?!

But this is contrary to marker behavior in the Project Explorer: 
- when a file has errors or warnings, the most severe of these is cascaded all the way to the top level also in expanded state
- when a file has outgoing changes, this marker is cascaded all the way to the top level also in expanded state

Also going from list to hierarchical complicates is a bit. Now we're trying to show a three-state situation with two different makers:
- task/container is in synch/has no incoming
- task has incoming
- descendant of task/container has incoming

Maybe you should go for a tri-state icon indicator rather than the current two-state.
Also note that incoming cascades upward, but outgoing does not. Why the asymmetry?</thetext>

As Maarten has suggested this is actually designed to work this way.  I believe the original intent here was to minimize the number of incoming blue arrows in the task list and since the query is expanded you will see what tasks have incoming anyway. Based on your feedback and Maarten's observation regarding propogation of decoration in the Package Explorer, we should re-evaluate this portion of the ui.

I agree, in/out should work the same and propagate to the top.  If we have both incoming and outgoing we could have a hybrid icon of the two arrows placed on the query  &lt;-&gt;. 

Mik, what are your thoughts on these ui issues?

    <thetext>Maarten: see bug 182772 for the discussion of why we chose to go with a customized rendering of incomings.  Since that bug we have reviewed this decision with the UI Working Group, and the main person responsible for the visual design of those decorations agreed that this was the best tradeoff for the Task List.  Regarding the incoming indicator, I have added some notes here: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn_Focused_UI_Design#Visual_Design  

Steffen: note that I just updated the policy to ensure that the incoming decorator does not get suppressed when not in focused mode, as per the above policy.  This is consistent with Mylyn 2.0/2.1.</thetext>

I am still seeing this behavior under Mylyn 3.4 (STS), OS X Cocoa.

I have a Query set up against Mylyn, and contained in the query are several regular issues and two issues with sub-tasks (280332 and 306001).

I have marked all issues as read, so in any case there should not be an 'incoming changes' arrow.

However:

If group subtasks is checked and the query folder is collapsed, the blue arrow does appear.

If group subtasks is checked and the query folder is expanded, the blue arrow does not appear

If group subtasks is not checked, the blue arrow does not appear in any case.


I was unable to reopen this issue due to permissions.  Perhaps the recipient of this comment can do so?</thetext>

    <thetext>Chris, that sounds like it is related to the presentation rather than the synchronization mechanism. I think some of the logic only looks one level deep when decorating incoming arrows (depending on the selected options) which could cause the inconsistencies that you have observed. It would be helpful if you could file a new bug to track that.</thetext>

    <thetext>Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a repository that requires passwords for task submission
2. Select a username
3. Enter the wrong password for that username. Hit Finish, do not attempt a query.
4. Attempt to submit a new task


Result:
Repository properties page pops up at once, no visible prompt to change password/username. If I continue to hit Finish, eventually my account will get locked out due to too many login attempts -- this message will be logged in the Task as a "Submit failed: " message.


Expected result:
It would be nice to see the error message reflect the server response, which warns that the password is incorrect. With the present setup it is easy to accidentally get locked out of a Bugzilla account. Some brief experimentation shows that the incorrect password warning does not appear for most actions. 

Because the authentication failure is potentially the most workflow disruptive (resulting in various sanctions depending on the installation), perhaps that error message message can be made to supercede all others when an action fails?</thetext>

    <thetext>The attachment details dialog does not follow all UI guidelines which should be easy to fix:

* The dialog needs a title.
* The page title should say "Attachment Details"
* The page descriptions should say "Modify attachment XYZ on bug ZYX."
* Move the obsolete checkbox on the same line as filename?
* The URL field should move above Advanced.
* The Advanced section should not be indented.
* The dialog should not be repacked when toggling Advanced.
* Borders for the flag input fields should not be form borders but use the standard platform style.
* The comment field should fill when making the dialog taller</thetext>

&gt; I am not sure if we need to make that resizable. Do we get a benefit for the
&gt; extra complexity?


Actual we use SashForm so it is no extra complexity.

One part is for the ScrolledComposite (with the Advanced Section) the other for the Comment.

I think it is better to make clear that you can change the Weights from 75 / 25 to a value that better fit the number of  flags that are defined (if visible).</thetext>

    <thetext>I added bugzilla.mozilla.org to the list of repositories and restarted Eclipse without checking save password. After a few failed background synchronizations my account was locked due to excessive login failures.

This is the email I got:

Your Bugzilla account was locked, as the maximum number (5) of
failed logins was exceeded. To unlock your account, visit the following link:

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/token.cgi?t=...&amp;a=unlock_account

The login attempts occurred from these IP addresses:

xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx at 2009-09-10 21:30:22
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx at 2009-09-10 21:30:22</thetext>

    <thetext>In Bugzilla 3.6 the following feature was added:
* Users are now locked out of their accounts for 30 minutes after trying five bad passwords in a row during login.

If your password is missing or mangled when you start eclipse then you can easily hit this limit, by opening a few tasks.  If your BugMail is turned off (BugMail is somewhat redundant when you use Mylyn) then you will not receive any email and there is no way to unlock your account, aside from waiting.  In 3.6 I'm not sure if the email would allow you to unlock your account or just makes you wait for 30 minutes.  

Bug #208839 seems more important given these recent changes to Bugzilla, IMO.</thetext>

    <thetext>I just experienced the same problem with bugs.eclipse.org.

We need to do something about this. The connector should at least stop authenticating when the login fails to avoid locking the account. Frank, it'd be great if you could look into this for 3.6 if you have some time.</thetext>

    <thetext>Mik suggested using the templates mechanism (RepositoryTemplate).  If we did this then a plugin could be provided that simply contributes a template for at particular repository along with the appropriate language. The language could be a sub element of the template extension point. 

Franks Comments from bug#173352
* If this is the enduser who is not a bugzilla admin then I think a preference page or a button in the BugzillaRepositorySettingPage. The same in someone use a Bugzilla which has localized templates.
* If you think that Mylyn should set up  all the language settings for the localized bugzilla templates (actually 17) with more then one available versions then I think the templates mechanism should be used.</thetext>

new version of templates.exsd

Question to emplates.exsd

1)  is it what you expected that language is an sequence to the extention

or

2) should language be an sequence to the repository element

Result

1) let you define an language for all bugzilla repositories but hen you need an new attribute (languageChoice) to say what language you want to Choice.

It is possible to an a new repository via popup menu 'Add Task Repository'.

2) It exists only one language settings per repository. But I see no way how to add a new repository with language settings via popup menu 'Add Task Repository'.

Is it right that 1) is the way to go one?

If yes then should we move BugzillaLanguageSettings from BugzillaCorePlugin to BugzillaRepositoryConnector?


BTW Should we do some cleanup on BugzillaLanguageSettings? To me it looks like invalid is only used with password so I think why not use 'Invalid Username Or Password' from bugzilla template/en/default/global/user-error.html.tmpl. Maybe ohters can change in the same way.</thetext>

    <thetext>I think (1) is the way to go here and the language extension point could have a connector kind field. Language templates as you suggest should be migrated to the connector (much like RepositoryTemplate).  Mik, perhaps these is a better baby step here before moving into the frame work though?

Regarding cleanup of BugzillaLanguageSettings, perhaps the template should consist of a token name like 'login' which maps to a sequence of acceptable variants (rather than having to have login2 like I added).</thetext>

&gt; Regarding cleanup of BugzillaLanguageSettings, perhaps the template should
&gt; consist of a token name like 'login' which maps to a sequence of acceptable
&gt; variants (rather than having to have login2 like I added).

What do you think about the following implementation

Sequence of Strings for the following entries
- RepositoryStatus.ERROR_REPOSITORY_LOGIN
- RepositoryStatus.REPOSITORY_COLLISION
- RepositoryStatus.REPOSITORY_COMMENT_REQUIRED
- RepositoryStatus.REPOSITORY_LOGGED_OUT
- BugzillaTaskHistoryParser.possibleBadLogin

for RepositoryStatus.ERROR_REPOSITORY_LOGIN and BugzillaTaskHistoryParser.possibleBadLogin we must change the and condition of "Invalid" and "Password" to match on string.  This can be 'Invalid Username Or Password'

The Result for 'en' and 'de' can look like
possibleBadLogin									en = "Login", "check e-mail", "Invalid Username Or Password", "error"
																	de = "Anmeldename erforderlich", "check e-mail", "Ungütiger Benutzername oder ungültiges Passwort", "error"

ERROR_REPOSITORY_LOGIN					en = "Login", "log in", "check e-mail", "Invalid Username Or Password"
																	de = "Anmeldename erforderlich", "check e-mail", "Ungütiger Benutzername oder ungültiges Passwort"

REPOSITORY_COLLISION						en = "Mid-air collision!"
																	de = "Kollision!"
REPOSITORY_COMMENT_REQUIRED		en = "Comment Required"
																	de = "Kommentar erforderlich"
REPOSITORY_LOGGED_OUT					en = "logged out"
																	de = "Abgemeldet"

Should I go and implement it like this 

Rob can you tell me what was the errorsituation for login2. I can not find it in the bugzilla templates within a titel</thetext>

patch with new Language extention

some points

- is it Ok to extend BugzillaCorePlugin to access AbstractRepositoryConnector or is there a better way?

- I only ad on test for the english version of invalid user or password. Is it possible to have an bugzilla installation with germzilla for testing?

- I think the definition of languages from extentionpoint is finished. What is next? Should we allow other ways of configuration and how to sync them?</thetext>

Updated patch

This is really great stuff Frank.  I just have some tests failing when running all bugzilla tests so we need to look into this. Once the tests are passing we can apply this and then consider the refinements.  I'm posting an updated version of your patch to work from.  We can iterate on this and get into next weeks build.</thetext>

    <thetext>After talking to Mik about this I realize we have to move the implementation back within the Bugizilla component. Since languages as the a Bugzilla implementation detail it should remain a Bugzilla specific capability.  This should be a simple refactoring i.e. moving extension point and moving AbstractRepositoryConnector code to BugzillaRepositoryConnector etc.  Wrt the extension point, ideally it should be a sequence of languageAttributes along the lines of:

   &lt;element name="languageAttribute"&gt;
      &lt;complexType&gt;
         &lt;attribute name="command" type="string"&gt;
            &lt;annotation&gt;
               &lt;documentation&gt;
                  
               &lt;/documentation&gt;
            &lt;/annotation&gt;
         &lt;/attribute&gt;
         &lt;attribute name="response" type="string"&gt;
            &lt;annotation&gt;
               &lt;documentation&gt;
                  
               &lt;/documentation&gt;
            &lt;/annotation&gt;
         &lt;/attribute&gt;
      &lt;/complexType&gt;
   &lt;/element&gt;

   
   Then the extension point reader would read in all these command/response pairs which are then held by LanguageSettings (move back into bugzilla).  The trick will then be knowing which command to get the response string for so each command may need a constant.  I apologize for not catching this sooner Frank. </thetext>

New Version of Patch

Some Comments.

1) testSubTaskHasIncoming fails because since 2007-11-16 14:43:05 bug 8 was removed from the Depends on list so task.getChildren().size() returns 1.

2) I think we should do some clean up of the command/responce entry. By example I can not find "check e-mail" in any title, so we can remove it.

3) Describe where in the bugzilla "en" template the responce strings so it is easy to found them in the localized versions.

BTW I also found that the Title was not correctly calculated.</thetext>

    <thetext>Great stuff here Frank. Patch applied and ip log have been updated. Lets leave 'check e-mail' as this may be returned by an older repository. I fixed (1) and I'm not certain I understand point (3).    My only outstanding concern here is that BugzillaRepositoryConnector.getLanguageSetting() can return null.  In the case of headless usage of this api things will not work unless a language is manually specified (I'll need to document this on the wiki).  Ideally this would return the 'en' template however this would require a hard coded version of this class.  Thoughts?</thetext>

&gt; Great stuff here Frank. Patch applied and ip log have been updated. Lets leave
&gt; 'check e-mail' as this may be returned by an older repository. I fixed (1) and
&gt; I'm not certain I understand point (3). 
Ok try to explain this in detail.
If we by example document that the value "Mid-air collision!" is the String defined as an title in file bugzilla-2.18.6/template/en/default/bug/process/header.html.tmpl line 31. Then for translate the String to german we must only look in file  bugzilla-2.18.6/template/de/default/bug/process/header.html.tmpl
fo find the translate of line 31.

&gt;  My only outstanding concern here is
&gt; that BugzillaRepositoryConnector.getLanguageSetting() can return null.  In the
&gt; case of headless usage of this api things will not work unless a language is
&gt; manually specified (I'll need to document this on the wiki).  Ideally this would
&gt; return the 'en' template however this would require a hard coded version of this
&gt; class.  Thoughts?

What is if we hard code the en version and only use addLanguageAttribute for the translated versions.

One other thing.
There is a problem with charactersets. The content of org.eclipse.mylyn.bugzilla.ui plugin.xml that I get from the repository
&lt;languageAttribute command="error_login" 				response="Ungâ€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢âˆšÃ„âˆšÃºâ€šÃ¢Ã Â¬âˆžâ€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ¡Â¬Â¨â€šÃ Â´tiger Benutzername oder ungâ€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢âˆšÃ„âˆšÃºâ€šÃ¢Ã Â¬âˆžâ€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ¡Â¬Â¨â€šÃ Â´ltiges Passwort"/&gt;

but the response should be response="Ungültiger Benutzername oder ungültiges Passwort"

&gt; &gt; 'check e-mail' as this may be returned by an older repository. I fixed (1) and
&gt; &gt; I'm not certain I understand point (3).
&gt; Ok try to explain this in detail.
&gt; If we by example document that the value "Mid-air collision!" is the String
&gt; defined as an title in file
&gt; bugzilla-2.18.6/template/en/default/bug/process/header.html.tmpl line 31. Then
&gt; for translate the String to german we must only look in file
&gt; bugzilla-2.18.6/template/de/default/bug/process/header.html.tmpl
&gt; fo find the translate of line 31.

We could document this on a link from http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn_Bugzilla_Connector
 
&gt; What is if we hard code the en version and only use addLanguageAttribute for the
&gt; translated versions.

Yes this sounds like the right way to go, and if we make BugzillaLanguageTemplate override equals and hash code and base equality on the language name the 'en' hard coded template could be overridden if desired by providing a new 'en' template via extension point.
 
&gt; One other thing.
&gt; There is a problem with charactersets. The content of
Apparently the create patch functionality doesn't support UTF-8. This should now be fixed in head.</thetext>

If you think it is up to me to do this I need a little more information. And after I edit be so kind and properly correct my not so perfect english.

What do you think to have "en (builtin)" and not to deal with hash code?</thetext>

I may have miss understood.  Do you mean to automatically parse the template to decipher the returned strings?

No I don't think that automaticlly is right. I would like to describe this like a cokbook. That mens what are the steps do add an actually not supported language.

BTW  If we want to do that does that meen that we have to do somethink like a Eclipse-RegisterBuddy: to allow the definition of a new laguagesetting

    <thetext>Patch applied with the following changes:  I extracted the constant to IBugzillaConstants.DEFAULT_LANG and removed dead code from RepositoryTemplate. Had to override hashcode and equals to ensure we don't get duplicate languages.  Updated BugzillaRepositoryConnector.getLanguageSetting() to return the default language rather than null.  Removed 'en' template from plugin.xml to avoid duplication in ui.

Ip log updated.

This should just be a matter of extending the "org.eclipse.mylyn.bugzilla.core.languages" extension point and your extension point reader will do the rest.  You could document this as well on that wiki page.

it seems that the tooltip fails to render properly when the bottom part
of the tooltip overlaps the top part of the Windows start bar (start bar's configured to be located in the bottom of the screen).

JFace ToolTip based implementation

Changed from custom tooltip handling code to new Eclipse 3.3 JFace ToolTip class.

- renamed TaskListToolTipHandler to TaskListToolTip
- I have removed the multi monitor handling code. Leo, please check if that is handled correctly by the JFace ToolTip class now

Rob, please review.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks Leo, I can reproduce this on Linux where it pops-up on the bottom left of the screen. Need to verify with the latest Eclipse version and file a bug against platform. The code in org.eclipse.jface.window.ToolTip.fixupDisplayBounds() doesn't seem to do the right thing.</thetext>

Rob, Leo, how important is it to address this for Mylyn until it is fixed in platform? As far as I can reproduce this on Linux the tooltip is always displayed but in an unexpected location.</thetext>

    <thetext>I think this is the lesser of two evils, at least the tooltip displays only like you said, in an unexpected location.

In your search through tooltip bugs, did you notice any about position relative to the mouse pointer? I'm finding it really annoying that when I click, the tooltip is intercepting resulting in the task not being selected. </thetext>

Yes there's one Bug #195137. I'm going to investigate this. The wrong positioning is something that's a bit hard to debug (because I don't have 2 monitors). Does it only happen in 2 monitor setups?

    <thetext>(In reply to comment #14)
&gt; In your search through tooltip bugs, did you notice any about position relative
&gt; to the mouse pointer? I'm finding it really annoying that when I click, the
&gt; tooltip is intercepting resulting in the task not being selected. 

The tooltip is displayed slightly to the left of the mouse pointer on my Linux system and disappears as soon as I move the mouse. I didn't notice any change in the selection behavior.

Yes, it only happens in multi-monitor setups.

    <thetext>The context exclusion patterns currently support workspace relative paths, but cannot be used to specify an exclude of an entire external location.  For example, any project linking content from a windows shared drive will pollute the context whenever a refresh happens.  This can be addressed in a straightforward way by adding support for using URIs for excludes in the changeMonitoring extension point.</thetext>

    <thetext>Rob, I see you are making changes to the preference page for this, so here are few comments:

createContents() method shoind NOT return parent. It should create its own composite and return it. Then list would fill in the vertical space properly. 
For consistency with other Eclipse property dialog, an "Add..." button should be "New..."
For the same reason it would make sense to have "Edit..." action too.

    <thetext>I find out that Orbit actually have no plans to provide update sites and my attempts to convince them to do that wasn't successful.

So, plugins would need to be downloaded from the Mylar's own update site. But then they would have to live in a separate feature that can can't be included and yet need to be required. This way uninstalling old version of Mylar won't wipe them out.</thetext>

    <thetext>Hmmm, my thinking is:
* If they get installed with Mylar, they live in a Mylar feature.  There is still benefit because a reinstall won't be required when the feature is updated with new Mylar plug-ins.  But uninstall of Mylar means they get uninstalled.
* If Orbit eventually provides an update site that more than one project can link their downloads to, then we link to that site and they won't get uninstalled.</thetext>

    <thetext>If you uninstall Mylar feature all its plugins will be wiped out. That also happens when you uninstall old versions of the feature (have to do that manually because Update Managed don't do that). So, the only option is to have separate feature for those plugins, either available from Mylar update site or from Orbit (which they are not planning to provide at this point).</thetext>

    <thetext>It looks like we won't be ready to to move to Orbit-based dependencies for 2.0M1.  One of my main concerns is that this could add significant complexity to our build process if we can't check out the plug-ins with pre-built JARs, or depend on them via an update site.  However, as a baby step I have moved all of our dependencies to the org.eclipse.mylar plug-in, which now contains library folders that group them:
* lib-axis
* lib-httpclient
* lib-xmlrpc</thetext>

    <thetext>I'd like to make an observation.

Right now you can just checkout projects from /cvsroot/technology/org.eclipse.mylar right from the IDE and you all set and can hack away. Can't be easier, but we still saw some developers confused about this process (well, actually they wanted to use 3.2 branch).

Now, let's say Mylar move to use Orbit stuff. What developer experience going to look like? I might be missing something, but from what I saw, it will be necessary to go to the org.eclipse.orbit tree (in different CVS root), then hunt for specific project name and then hunt again for specific version/branch name. At minimum it looks error prone.</thetext>

    <thetext>I'm concerned about this too, because it has been important for us to maintain a low bar to contribution by making it possible to get going with Mylar by either checking everything out in our root CVS directory or by checking out a single project set (we encourage the latter).  This is particularly important for newcommers to Eclipse.  http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Mylar_Contributor_Reference#Workspace

However, perhaps if we update our project sets to include the relevant projects from Orbit this will be easy enough.  

Chris: could you please point me at the project set?</thetext>

    <thetext>Any updates to this? The checking out of jar files from org.eclipse.mylyn.web.core perked my interest in scanning bugzilla.

Per the Europa Simultaneous Release guidelines' "Must Do #7"...

Any third-party plug-ins that are common between projects must be consumed via Orbit; the final Europa release will not have duplicate third-party libraries (note that this only applies to identical versions of the libraries; thus if project A requires foo.jar 1.6 and project B uses foo.jar 1.7, that's ok).[1]

...and the same will be applied to Ganymede.[2] Orbit has Commons Codec 1.3.0, Commons Logging 1.0.4, and Commons HttpClient 3.0.1 (though I do from bug 2034303 that there's a plan to move to 3.1.0)

    <thetext>An observation. I see few projects consuming orbit bundles (i.e. Spring IDE and q4e projects) and install them with their own features, but then Eclipse Update Manager and Eclipse runtime behave really funny and raise all kind of confusing warnings when they see duplicate bundles installed.</thetext>

    <thetext>(In reply to comment #2)
&gt; I wonder if it would be better on AbstractRepositoryConnectorUi since that's
&gt; where most of the URL stuff is, and since Web UI based viewing of history is a
&gt; UI concept?

You probably used the same reasoning when you put getAccountCreationUrl() and getAccountManagementUrl() into the UI pluging. However all those urls could be also useful for headless tools as well as the UI actions and the url is more like repository-specific metadata rather then something related to UI. The actions that would use those urls in Mylyn would of course live in UI.

Anyways, I don't want to argue about this and if you convinced UI is better place for new getHistoryUrl() call, let's put it into UI, so it would be possible to fix bug 214134.</thetext>

    <thetext>Two classes in tasks.core, TaskActivityManager and AbstractAttachmentHandler, cause a dependency on context.core. This should be avoided:

- Context attachment related code should be moved to a utility class in context.ui.
- Task activity monitoring related code should be extracted from TaskActivityManager and moved to a separate internal class in tasks.ui.
- TaskActivityManager should not be a singleton. It's life cycle should be managed in tasks.ui similar to other instances of tasks core classes, e.g. TaskList.</thetext>

    <thetext>I am seeing the following entries in the Error Log view. It look really suspicious, because decoration in the task list shows that bug 194973 does have local context, so there could be some synchronization issue, i.e. backup is running in parallel with some other processes that may be updating same files.

    <thetext>We should consider to provide source bundles for Ganymede. The way these are build has been improved for 3.4:

http://wiki.eclipse.org/PDEBuild/Individual_Source_Bundles

We need to investigate how that fits into the build process and how that affects builds for 3.3.</thetext>

    <thetext>The PDE build will generate source plug-ins and source features when these two lines are added to the feature.xml and build.properties of the feature:

feature.xml:
 &lt;includes id="org.eclipse.mylyn_feature.source" version="0.0.0"/&gt;

build.properties:
 generate.feature@org.eclipse.mylyn_feature.source=org.eclipse.mylyn_feature
 
Mik, what are your thoughts in regard to providing these on the update site? Should we create a "Mylyn SDK" feature that contains all sources or have an SDK category with individual SDK downloads for each feature or do this some other way?</thetext>

    <thetext>To avoid adding 16 new source features it might be more feasible to add one SDK feature per update site that has sources for all plug-ins on that site, e.g.:

 org.eclipse.mylyn.sdk-feature
 org.eclipse.mylyn.extras-sdk-feature
 org.eclipse.mylyn.experimental-sdk-feature

Each site could have a "Mylyn Development" category for that feature.</thetext>

update site

I am not sure that I like the "Development" category above the other categories. Other than that I think it works well on the main update site. How about renaming the category to "Mylyn Software Development" to improve the ordering?

Should I go ahead an create the other features proposed in comment 2? I think it would be good to have the SDK features before the next release to give integrators easy access to the source.</thetext>

    <thetext>I agree. The only thing that concerns me with this bug is that this is actually causing a deadlock of the UI when highlighters are used. I looked into fixing this but this may require restructuring of some of the code and may not be trivial.</thetext>

    <thetext>I am investigating the problem that the highlight display is not done.
And, this bug was found. 

I saw the stack trace. 
But, where became a deadlock is not understood. 

I think that it is a cause to use thread unsafe's ArrayList class in HighlighterList class. 
How if the operation to highlighters (ArrayList) is moved in the synchronized block ?

    <thetext>I believe the problem is that the static initialization of ColorMap is triggered by the lightweight decorator which runs on a non-UI thread while at the same time the UI thread tries to use the ColorMap by instantiating HighlighterList which references ColorMap in its static initialization. The UI thread is now holding the SWT lock while waiting for the lightweight decorator thread to finish initialization of ColorMap and that thread is waiting for the SWT lock. I am not sure if this problem affects other platforms than Linux.

proposed fix

The patch triggers initialization of ColorMap during startup and synchronizes the initizialization of the HighligherList instance in SandboxUiPlugin. That should work around the deadlock and fix the ConcurrentModificationException.</thetext>

    <thetext>Steffen: My suggestion here is that we create two capabilities.

* Mylyn Task-Focused Interface
** All the focus buttons
** Preference pages

* Mylyn Task Management
** Task List view
** Task Repositories view
** Creation wizards
** Preference pages</thetext>

    <thetext>I have committed the new plug-in and defined the following capabilities:

# Mylyn
## Task Management
## Task-Focused Interface
## WikiText

David, the WikiText capability currently applies to all extensions that have an id matching org.eclipse.mylyn.wikitext.ui.*. Please feel free to modify the plugin.xml of the capabilities plug-in as needed.

    <thetext>I have extended the patterns to include all Mylyn plug-ins. Disabling the Task-Focused interface hides all focus buttons. There are some problems if the Task-Focused Interface is enabled but Task Management is not: Some contributions such as the Context preferences page will be missing since the parent contribuition (Tasks page) is missing.

I was unsure about the o.e.m.team.ui contributions. I have included  those under Task-Focused Interface for now. 

David, the WikiText capability now matches all WikiText plug-ins: org\.eclipse\.mylyn\.wikitext\..*/.*. Please feel free to change that if it's too greedy.

I have moved the category definitions and bindings to the org.eclipse.galileo plug-in.</thetext>

Looks good to me though I'm not sure how it would behave with all of Mylyn enabled except for WikiText.  Would the taskEditorExtensions be available in the repository properties dialog?  If so, how would the task editor work?  Would it have the WikiText editor (if configured to have it) and if so would things like content assist and cheat sheet help work?

No, the extension now checks against the enablement of the capability.

I am not sure. This needs to be tested.

    <thetext>When submitting tasks it is sometimes useful to know the old values of the attributes which have changed.

Possible use cases:

# sending 'delta' changes to the repository for efficiency resons
# efficiently handling operations which the repository implements with delete/create 

As a contributor in the Mantis connector, I've hit the second case with when mapping task relations, and I can only move forward if I can know which task relations where changed, if any. Otherwise I need to delete all relations ( 1 + n SOAP calls ) and then re-create them ( n SOAP calls ) which is a lot of trouble, especially since they don't change often.

Please consider implementing TaskDataModel.getChangedOldAttributes.

Thank you,

Robert

    <thetext>I might we wrong, but from the context it seem like org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.context.core.InteractionContext is using mostly-add for the collected events. If that is indeed the case, it should not be using CopyOnWriteArrayList to deal with concurrency issues, because that is too costly. See corresponding javadoc at http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CopyOnWriteArrayList.html

Here is fragment of thread dump I am seeing quite often (even when there is no active task).

    <thetext>I converted the CopyOnWriteArrayList to an ArrayList in my local workspace and haven't had any CME's.  By looking at the implementation, I have confirmed that all of the operations to the InteractionContext are performed on the UI thread (i.e. locking is already performed) or the context is only being written to (i.e. collapsing of the activity context[1]).  Since many handlers of interaction events (e.g. context listeners) assume that operations are performed on the UI thread, I think that it is safe to change this to ArrayList until the need for concurrency arises.  

Steffen, Mik, what are your thoughts?

fn1. The only potential problem is with InteractionContext.getInteractionHistory(), but returning a copy of the interaction history would solve this concern.</thetext>

    <thetext>How is this change going to affect InteractionContext.collapseActivityMetaContext()? As far as I can tell the method needs a copy of the interaction history and is not called on the UI thread so there is a chance of CMEs (even if a copy is made).</thetext>

    <thetext>InteractionContextManager.collapseActivityMetaContext collapses one context into another.  The original context is iterated over (need the copy so no CME when adding an event to the activity meta context), and the second one is added to, so there shouldn't be a CME from that.  Let me know if I am wrong about this.</thetext>

&gt; autopin?

I don't think so.  Would you want to disable the complete tweaklet, or just the fact that it automatically pins (prevents from reusing) an editor that has been edited?

The auto-pin tweaklet is very similar to the behaviour you get when you go to the editors preference page and enable editor reuse with a threshhold of one editor, except that you will have to pin the editor explicitly using the toolbar button with the green "pin".  Have you tested Mylyn with these (regular) settings as well?

The auto-pin source code is in CVS at:
/cvsroot/eclipse/platform-incubator/ui/tweaklets/</thetext>

&gt; I don't think so.  Would you want to disable the complete tweaklet, or 
&gt; just the fact that it automatically pins (prevents from reusing) an editor
&gt; that has been edited?

I think there should be some way to disable any changes in behavior this tweaklet does. Even just from the general end user experience it would be useful to see what changes when you turn this thing on and off using some preferences in regular Preferences UI. Now you have to uninstall it which is much more troublesome and confusing.

&gt; The auto-pin tweaklet is very similar to the behaviour you get when you go to
&gt; the editors preference page and enable editor reuse with a threshhold of one
&gt; editor, except that you will have to pin the editor explicitly using the
&gt; toolbar button with the green "pin".  Have you tested Mylyn with these
&gt; (regular) settings as well?

The thing is that Mylyn disables editor management (just changing platform settings) and it has its own (more sophisticated) facility to track and close editors. I'll try to spend some more time with this later, but it doesn't seem like they work well together.</thetext>

&gt; Does someone have a proposal for how to address this on the Mylyn side?  I
&gt; haven't seen the point of using the tweaklet with Mylyn since I rely entirely
&gt; on Mylyn's editor management.  But if others are using Mylyn with the tweaklet,
&gt; and think that there is a complementary overlap, please post.  

I've used the autopin tweaklet + working sets + mylyn, and the combination is rather unbearable. The workaround I've been using is to disable mylyn's filtering of the Pack Expl view, and to simply close all / scroll a lot. It's bearable, but not entirely happy.

For the next while I'm going to turn off the tweaklet and just use Mylyn, in an attempt to retrain my brain to that better workflow. 

However, if you really wanted to integrate the two, here's a sample workflow with resulting events that might work:

0. open file A [mylyn marks it important] [not pinned]
1. open file B [mylyn: important] [tab reused] [A does not get marked LESS important even though its editor is now effectively closed]
2. edit file B [mylyn: more important] [tab is now pinned]
3. open file C [important] [second tab added, but unpinned]
4. disable task [all tabs closed]
5. re-enable task [files B and C are opened; C is not pinned; B is pinned; A is still important, but not opened]

I suppose this would mean splitting [context: all files] from [working files: files to be opened], so that you can have things that are important (in context) but which won't automatically open when the task is turned on.

The great thing with this is that it would allow relevant-but-closed files (eg., php includes, css, images, .dotfiles) to be easily added to a context without ending up with umpteen open tabs. It would also mean that the effect of closing a tab (and thus its file) would NOT mean marking a file "less important."

    <thetext>What are the use cases for the editor pin tweaklet with Mylyn?  I haven't tried it myself because I'm accustomed to relying on Mylyn for keeping the right files open, but I could be missing something.  Either way we should either address the overlap or get Nick's instructutions into the FAQ.</thetext>

    <thetext>Boris: we would love to convert you if at all possible ;)  The automatic filtering and hiding will be more obvious in Mylyn 3.0, where we're planning on replacing the need to Alt+click with a custom affordance.  It would be great if you could try Mylyn again at that time.  For now, if you're interested, note that you can selectively turn off any Mylyn feature: http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Mylyn_FAQ#Which_Focused_UI_features_can_I_turn_off.3F  </thetext>

&gt; replacing the need to Alt+click with a custom affordance.  It would be great if

ALT-click (to show unfiltered children of a folder) doesn't work in my particular flavour of Linux (I run KDE)... but ALT-right-arrow, SHIFT-right-arrow, and CTRL-right-arrow all do. Just FYI. 

Even though that's a crazy-useful shortcut, I still tend to have to toggle Focus on Active Task a lot when I'm first setting up a task. I wish when I started a new task that instead of having an empty Package Explorer, Mylyn would default to NOT filtering until I had at least N files selected, where N is a parameter I could set, depending on the type of work item I'm doing. A nice default might be 1, 3, or 5 entities, be they files, methods, classes, or other nodes.

Or, maybe show me all my Working Sets, and let me browse them w/ ALT-arrow? </thetext>

    <thetext>Hi Steffen,
I started with a similar approach as in your patch - I used ITask as the argument for the new method but then I realized that it's not possible to directly get a project id from ITask, so I switched to TaskData.

Did I miss something? Is there any simple way to get project id for ITask?

Cheers,
Pawel</thetext>

    <thetext>Yes, this will require storing the projectId on the task. I have commented on bug 290490 with a suggestion. The reason I do not want to include TaskData is for consistency with similar API methods and that TaskData may not be available in all cases, e.g. for web based tasks.

    <thetext>Mylyn currently uses PriorityLevel P1 - P5 for tasks in the TaskList.  This priority handling always feld backwards to me.  I thought that I should go ahead and propose an enhancement based on how I originally expected Mylyn to handle things.  

That is, Mylyn would show the value from TaskData.getMappedAttribute(TaskAttribute.PRIORITY) field instead of P1 - P5?  Instead of showing the user getting the connectors to map their priorities to Mylyn's priority list, the idea is to let all connectors use their native priority levels and to provide a mapper or comparator for Mylyn to use when sorting those values across one or more repositories.

Here are some examples of problems with the current system.  

* My connector's priority field is called "severity" in the task repository.  While users talk about "sev 1" and "sev 2" issue, the interface for this repository doesn't even show the numeric severity value.  The web interface displays the severity/priority as "Normal", "Show stopper", etc.  Thus, while the priority icons make sense to the user, the Task List view's tool tip for tasks from this repository shows P1.  The users are always confused by that value at first and have no idea that it corresponds to the severity field.  If they saw "sev 1" or "show stopper" in the tool tip, it would reduce support requests from our users.  (Our users are mostly new to Mylyn.  Our connector is brining them to Mylyn for the first time.)

*My repository has more than 5 severity levels.  I'm not sure why we need to map priorities from various task repositories into a scale of 5. I understand that it makes sorting across repositories easier, but it means that users who use just one connector to a repository with more than 5 priority levels can never get a proper sort by priority.  Some of his tasks with different priorities will end up in the same "bucket" in priority sorts.  

The obvious drawback of this feature is that users with tasks from heterogeneous repositories in their Task List would see a different values in the Task List tool tip.  That is, all of the old P1 bugs will still be sorted to the top of the list with the same icon, but the value in the tool tip might show "Critical" for one repository, and "Sev 1" for another repository.  That actually makes more sense to me, but it would be a user-visible change from previous versions of Mylyn.

If Mylyn were to handle priorities this way, connectors could map their priority to a float value from -1 (lowest priority) to 0 (normal) to 1 (highest priority).
So, for 5 priorities, you'd have -1, -.5, 0, .5, and 1.  Another repository with 8 priorities might use -1, -.75, -.5, -.25, 0, .5, .75, 1.  That way, heterogeneous sorting could still keep highest, normal, and lowest priorities grouped together across all repositories.  But when sorting the tasks for a single repositories, the finer granularity would be preserved.</thetext>

    <thetext>Tom, I have a similar problem with the Rally connector, except that the "priority" of a task is just a floating point number with no real notion of a priority.  I am working on a patch that adds a "rank" to a task.  This rank would be a floating point number that can be used for sorting along with the P1-P5 mappings.  The P1-P5 mappings would still be used (if the connector wishes to) to show the priority icon in the Task List.  Sorting with this "rank" would first sort by the P1-P5 priorities, and then by the "rank".  This would mean that a homogeneous container could be sorted exactly as specified by the rank, and heterogeneous containers would still be sorted in a logical way using the Priority and then the rank.  This would give connector developers the ability to show the priority icons as well as sort in a more logical way when there are more than the 5 priorities.

Does this approach sound like it will work for you? From your post, I think that it will.</thetext>

    <thetext>Steffen and I chatted about this a bit more and have come up with a solution that I think will work for all cases.  Since not all priorities can be normalized across repositories, we would have 3 fields related to a priority on a Task:

* Priority String (shown in the tooltips and editor)
* Priority Level (used to determine the icon used in the Tasklist and for sorting)
* Rank (used just for sorting and may not be visible to a user at all)

With this, we can allow users to choose to sort based on Rank or Prioirty (or both) in the Tasklist from the "Sort..." view menu.  For connectors like bugzilla, the rank and Priority Level are directly related, whereas with other repositories, they may be separate.  The only weird thing with sorting by rank is how things may sort in categories since the ranks are repository specific.</thetext>

    <thetext>That sounds good.  

The priority string is provided by the connector (and possibly driven by custom values in the repository), right?

I assume that the priority level would work just like it does today (except that the custom priority string is displayed instead of P1, P2, etc.).

It sounds like heterogeneous rank sorts might not make any sense at all.  You'll also see this in the Scheduled view.  For example, I might sort all of my tasks for Today by rank.  If I have tasks from different repository types scheduled, then I may not get a meaningful sort.  On the other hand, sorting by rank is probably what the user wants when looking at queries in the Task List.  

Have you considered going with the updated plan but still using a Priority then Rank sort for the Rank thing?  I assume that would make the sort code more complex, but it would probably provide a more meaningful sort across heterogeneous repositories.

    <thetext>We have looked at Rally and JIRA more closely and determined that rank does not always correspond to priority. Our current thinking is that we have three separate fields:

* String priority;
* PriortyLevel priorityLevel; // enum P1..P5
* float rank;

The user would have to choose to either sort by Priority or Rank. We'll need some more discussion how to handle the cases when containers are not homogeneous such as categories or the scheduled presentation. There is also a question what to do in Focus on Workweek mode which currently forces Priority ordering.</thetext>

    <thetext>I see.  OK.  In that case, I think that sorting by Rank would at least meet my need to ensure that sorting maintains my connector's ordering by its Severity field even though there are more than 5 distinct severities in my repository.

Patch

Here is a patch that will allow the user to choose the option to sort by rank and by priority.  This will allow connectors that have more than 5 values to specify a rank that should be compared instead.  The only question remaining is whether this should be the default sorting or not.

    <thetext>I have implemented rank-based sorting.  The behavior in focused mode is unaffected.  Rank sorting is based on an attribute with a double value on the task with the TaskAttribute.RANK key which should be set in the updateTaskFromTaskData i.e. task.setAttribute(TaskAttribute.RANK, stringValue);.

The default sort for new Mylyn installations is priority, rank, date created.  This will leave most task sortings unaffected as there is no rank field.  For tasks with a rank, the task will be sorted as expected provided that all of the tasks have the same priority.</thetext>

    <thetext>In the CopyContextHandler, we now copy the editor mementos as well.  This should fit with users expectations better.  I had to move the initialization of the ContextEditorManager to the start() method of the ContextUiPlugin, but I left the listener initialization in the lazy start since we now need the ContextEditorManager even if a context has never been activated.</thetext>

    <thetext>The following internal provisional packages were not marked as x-internal which prevents them from moving into API without breaking backwards compatibility:

 org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.provisional.commons.ui.dialogs  (since 3.3)
 org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.provisional.tasks.bugs  (since 3.2)

This affects moving the support extension point into API (bug 294957) since that involves renaming the org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.provisional.tasks.bugs package to org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.bugs. 

There are two alternatives:
* Leave internal packages as API but deprecate classes to maintain binary compatibility. The disadvantage is that multiple classes with the same name would exist in different namespaces which is confusing.
* Remove API, inform integrators and add API filters to suppress API tooling errors.</thetext>

    <thetext>As discussed on the call today, I have marked org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.provisional.commons.ui.dialogs as x-internal in the manifest. This change only affects clients running in strict mode that where relying on the package being publicly visible. 

The org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.provisional.tasks.bugs has been renamed to org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.bugs. The changes are described on bug 294957.

The consensus was that not marking packages in an internal namespace as x-internal is a defect. While constituting a breaking change in terms of API tooling internal.provisional packages were always considered internal by convention and the changes above restore the clear split between API and internals while avoiding additional baggage caused by deprecating and duplicating classes for instance.

Integrators, please reopen this bug and comment here if these changes cause any problems.</thetext>

    <thetext>There are several use cases such as handling of selections in the task editor outline, opening of a particular attribute/comment in the editor from a hyperlink or highlighting of search matches that require an operation to select and reveal a model element in the task editor. Since the editor UI and task data model differs significantly between connectors the API needs to be extensible and flexible, e.g.:

 public class AbstractTaskEditorPage {

   public boolean selectAndReveal(IAdaptable element);

 }</thetext>

    <thetext>Steffen,

for Bugzilla we have an Map&lt;TaskAttribute, AbstractAttributeEditor&gt; an use this for refresh if the product was changed.

Can we generalize this?

    <thetext>We would need something like that but potentially more generic, e.g. when linking to a comment you may not have the corresponding TaskAttribute object but just the number of the comment. We also need to consider the case where the attributes section is not yet expanded and hence no mapping to the attribute editor exists, yet, so selectAndReveal() would have to expand the section that contains the model element first.</thetext>

    <thetext>I have commited a first cut of the generic XML-RPC layer in the new org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.xmlrpc plug-in. Frank, can you take a look and check if that works for Bugzilla?

XmlRpcClientTest and XmlRpcOperationTest have some sample code. The basic idea is that you create an instance of CommonXmlRpcClient and a subclass of XmlRpcOperation. The client holds the shared state between all calls and manages the transport (Apache XML-RPC). If needed you can customize the authentication, exception handling etc. by overriding protected methods in XmlRpcOperation. Let me know if you need additional hooks.

The client code should look something like this:

BugzillaXmlRpcClient {

  public BugzillaXmlRpcClient() {
    client = new CommonXmlRpcClient(repositoryLocation);
  }
  
  public voidDoSomething(final IProgressMonitor monitor) {
    	Integer response = (new BugzillaXmlRpcOperation&lt;Integer&gt;(client) {
			@Override
			public Integer execute() throws XmlRpcException {
			    Integer id = (Integer) call(monitor, "Bugzilla.createBug", "summary", "description");
				return call(monitor, "Bugzilla.doSomething", id);
			}
		}).execute();
    
  }
  
}

abstract BugzillaXmlRpcOperation extends XmlRpcOperation {

  protected boolean handleAuthenticationException(int code, AuthScheme authScheme) throws XmlRpcException {
    ... do something custom if needed ...
    super.handleAuthenticationException(code,authScheme);
  }
  
}</thetext>

Steffen,

for Bugzilla I need to test if the response is from type text/xml.

If not we have an error.
1) like some modules for xmlrpc are not installed
or
2) wrong HTTP Authentication

Is this OK?

    <thetext>Fixed for RC2. I did not include org.eclipse.cdt.mylyn in the SDK feature since it adds a dependency on CDT that is not part of the Eclipse SDK and probably only relevant to very few consumers of the Mylyn SDK. If there is interest in including CDT in the SDK feature we can reconsider or create a separate Mylyn CDT SDK feature.</thetext>

    <thetext>turns out the build was failing on my mac because a previous build had been aborted and only some of the tasks.ui sources were obtained from CVS.  Because I was using build-3.4.sh instead of build.sh, the old sources were never removed and thus I was building from a partial and stale source tree.

To summarize what I had to do to get this to work:

# copy @local.sh-template@ to @local.sh@
## alter @JAVA_HOME=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK/Home@
# @chmod 0755 *.sh@
# alter @3.4/config/build.properties@
## @bootclasspath=${java.home}/../Classes/classes.jar@
# alter @3.3/config/build.properties@
## @bootclasspath=${java.home}/../Classes/classes.jar@

perhaps this could be added to the build documentation somewhere?</thetext>

&gt; I definetly want to take a look at the common builder in the upcoming weeks and
&gt; rewrite the our build to rely on ant entirely instead of invoking sed as part
&gt; of the build...

great!  The current setup is a real headache.  (no offense!)

    <thetext>Build ID: 20090621-0832

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Setup 2 very large (20K files) projects, call then p1 and p2.
2. Create a task. Add a few resources from p1 and a perhaps 100 from p2 to the context.
3. view resources from Navigator with Focus On Active Task. You should see a small tree of p1 items and a larger tree of p2 items.
4. Right click on p1 and Remove From Context
5. Entire UI hangs for at least 30 min.  I have to kill it.

More information:
After killing, restarting, and repeating 3 times, I can reproduce this with my existing workspace ( I didnt create the projects each time since they are already there).  There is nothing is the logs indicating a problem.

I can successfully removeFromContext leaf nodes, one at a time, in the navigator tree (it takes 10-120 seconds).  But even when all node are removed except for the project itself, removeing the project hangs the UI.

It doesnt seem to matter what filter I have for the workingSet (I have them arranged by project and one filter for ALL).

This is a fresh Galileo j2ee install with Mylyn 3.2.0-v20090617-0100-e3x and the jira plugin (installed using the mylyn addl connectors option) and the tigris svn plugin for mylyn.</thetext>

    <thetext>I dont know if this is related or should be reported separately but there is an intolerable UI performance issue with this workspace.  If I have a task editor open (though not necessarily visible) for the current task, I see in the Context tab a section titled '51098 Invisble Elements'.
It appears that whenever performing almost any edit in a java editor, an eclipse background task is spawned, appears in the Progress window as 'Updating Invisible Elements In Context Page', and lives for perhaps 200ms-2s. This causes an intolerable UI hang for a few hundred ms to a few seconds on almost any java edit making the whole UI unusable.  It seems that if I simply close the task editor, the performance problem is gone.

When I reopen the task editor, the problem doesnt immediately reappear but it may reappear if, in the task editor, I open the Context tab and then proceed to edit some java code. The simple workaround is to keep closed the task editor for the infocus task. But it took quite a bit of frustrating UI slowness for me to dig in and find this workaround.

    <thetext>I upgraded to Mylyn 3.2.1 and repeated the steps and eclipse hangs for approx 4 minutes (app doesnt even redraw the screen).  The app seems to peg one whole core for that time.  However, the app does recover.  I dont know if this is better than before because my context is not exactly the same as the original test.
I noted that there was only 1 'invisible' element in this case.</thetext>

About how many elements were you removing from the context?  Also, did you have the context page of the task editor open when performing this?  If so, could you try with the task editor closed and see if you get the same results?</thetext>

    <thetext>There were 2 elements being removed when I choose Remove From Context on the P1 project.  The other project had approx 50 elements.
I repeated the experiment with the task editor closed at the operation is fast, approx 2 seconds.  I repeated it again with the editor open but not in focus and again it hangs.  Let me know if there is any other testing you need.

Stack trace

Using Mylyn 3.4.0

I also have problems with the performance of Remove From Context (Project Explorer). My workspace is pretty large (100K+ files). At first I had one project with a context containing around 10 files. I created a second project (CDT), very big. Now if I activate my task, open my second project, the whole project tree is in light gray, so I have to remove from context which is very slow. Even if I do it folder by folder, it's still very slow. I'm attaching a stack but I don't think it's very useful.</thetext>

    <bug_when>2010-08-19 11:43:06 -0400</bug_when>
    <thetext>I can confirm this bug as well.

We have an extremely large, very, very old repository containing 87k files. We also use an unstable mainline approach to build management, so we have our mainline trunk and at this point I have 2 other branches checked out. So I have roughly 87x*3= +/- 250k files.

Whenever I do a ^H search or an SVN update with an active task, the context absorbs every file that scores a hit in the search or that's updated via SVN. That's bad enough, but it's a different bug. The big deal is the fact that when I go to drop the extraneous files out of my context it can take up to 15 minutes for the process to finish.

As the others noted, dropping individual assets is instant. Even dropping large folders (containing hundreds or thousands of items) out of the context is pretty quick. But if I try to remove one of the root folders or the project itself from the context I'm looking at 15 minutes or so. Also worth noting is the fact that the time doesn't seem to be any longer if I ctrl-click more than one build in the context window. So if I have files from 3 projects (where project == build, I check each build out into it's own project) in a context and I only want one of them there, if I ctrl-click the other two and do Remove From Context it's about 15 minutes to finish. If I do them one at a time, it's 15 minutes each.

Also worth noting is the fact that we use Subversion, JIRA, Fisheye and Crucible and I have the Atlassian connectors for Mylyn installed.</thetext>

patch

Here is a patch that I will commit to HEAD and backport that should improve the performance of this operation by batching the elements that are to be removed from the context and only notifying the change once.  Previously, every element that was selected was processed separately.</thetext>

patch

It turns out that there was another problem here.  When removing items from context, it wasn't properly checked if the element was a part of the context or not, so it would try tro remove all elements in the tree that it could find.  I want to do a bit more testing, but the test case that I added originally had 17 changes when the project was removed from the context and it was the only item in the context.</thetext>

    <thetext>When adding time tracking support for the Mantis connector I was hit by the fact that I want to display the elapsed time nicely formatted, but there is not TaskAttribute.TYPE_DURATION or similar. I've resorted to holding 2 pieces of information : the raw duration , in minutes, and the formatted duration.

Having a task attribute type defined in the framework would aid with such an use case.</thetext>

    <thetext>The best way to start would be to look at subclasses of AbstractAttributeEditor. You would need to add a new type to TaskAttribute and extend AttributeEditorFactory to create the corresponding editor for the type. I have attached a context with some of the relevant classes.</thetext>

    <thetext>Duration seems to come in different formats depending on the connector kind (and maybe even configuration of the server). So I think this type_duration attribute editor needs to be read_only (as long as bug 242430 is not implemented) so that the connector can provide the means of validating input. Does that make sense?</thetext>

    <thetext>Yes, for Mantis and that specific attribute that is true. However other attributes (e.g. effort) can have various formats (e.g. in Jira there is a 2w 1d 3h format, others have just hours), which should be editable.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thomas, I agree that the way repositories display and allow input for effort / duration / work done is different. What I want to underline though is that there is common ground: the attribute specifies a duration. This should be internally stored in the same way for all repositories. 

Allowing the attribute to be editable means that different connectors might choose to have their own way of displaying this time input, but I guess that's another discussion.</thetext>

Threaddump while waiting for a file to be opened

Any user interaction if Mylyn is enabled such as
- activating a task
- opening a file
- expanding a tree node in the Package Explorer
takes literally minutes (1–3 minutes depending on the interaction) where the UI is frozen and Eclipse is using up one CPU core completely.

As a workaround one can disable Focusing in the Package Explorer, but of course one loses one of the more important features of Mylyn by this.

I had 2 small projects and 2 large, monolithic projects open. Project size seems to matter, because I don't see the issue with only small projects open.

    <thetext>Looking at the provided stack trace, it seems that the automatic linking is being the problem.  Without a task active, can you enable the "Link with Editor" feature in the package explorer (the toolbar button with the arrows pointing both ways) and see if you have a similar problem (especially when the Package Explorer is collapsed and you use "Open Type" or "Open Resource" to open a file).

Since it seems to be frozen for a long time, do you think that you could get a few stack dumps during that time frame so we can see if this is what is causing the problem or if that just happened to be running when you took the stack dump?  Also, how large are the monolithic projects so that I can try to reproduce this here?</thetext>

    <thetext>(In reply to comment #2)

Thanks for your quick reply!

I have taken a series of threaddumps with one large project open. It was the first time of opening the Task List and activating one local task. They are each about 1 minute apart.

If "Link with Editor" is enabled and Mylyn disabled (by closing the Task List), files are opened quickly in about 2 seconds.

One of the large projects has 22000 Java-Files in about 7300 directories (didn't count the packages exactly).</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks for all of the additional stacks and the testing!  After looking at this more, it seems that the problem is due to the focusing trying to load the Java model for these large projects which can take a lot of time.  I will have to look into this to see if there is anything that we can do to improve the performance for projects this large.</thetext>

    <thetext>I'm using mylyn in my client application. 
To keep control over the different logging frameworks, I'm using Logback (http://logback.qos.ch/).
The package "org.apache.commons.logging" is provided by a plug-in called "com.springsource.slf4j.org.apache.commons.logging" and not the usual "org.apache.commons.logging".

The two mylyn plug-ins "org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.ui" and "org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.net" have a dependency on the "org.apache.commons.logging" plug-in.
To be more flexible, mylyn should import the package/packages instead of having a dependency on the "org.apache.commons.logging" plug-in.</thetext>

    <thetext>Turns out that org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.net re-exports it's dependencies. Unfortunately that prevents a change from require bundle to import package without breaking API. I'm afraid this request will have to wait until Mylyn 4.0.</thetext>

    <thetext>Mylyn currently supports three different Eclipse platform versions: 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. With the Eclipse Galileo release support for Eclipse 3.6 will be added. Due to the way Mylyn's integrates with the platform it is not always possible to solely rely on API and a number of Mylyn plug-ins have been branched for Eclipse 3.3 to account for changes in the platform. In other places reflective code is used to make the implementation work across all supported Eclipse versions. 

The maintenance of branches, reflective code, multiple update sites and testing on different Eclipse versions imposes significant overhead on Mylyn committers. Feedback from the Mylyn community suggests that Eclipse 3.3 usage has decreased significantly and major Eclipse based product and distributions have moved to Eclipse 3.4 at this point. In order to reduce the maintenance overhead it is planned to end support for Eclipse 3.3 starting with Mylyn 3.3. In addition this will enable Mylyn to take advantage of platform enhancements added in Eclipse 3.4.</thetext>

Steffen, could you comment which 3.4 feature you are planning to use?

    <thetext>(In reply to comment #1)
&gt; could you comment which 3.4 feature you are planning to use?

Supporting Eclipse 3.3 means that we have code that looks like this:

bc. 
informationControlCreator = new IInformationControlCreator() {
				@SuppressWarnings("deprecation")
				public IInformationControl createInformationControl(Shell shell) {
					try {
						// try reflection to access 3.4 APIs
						// 	DefaultInformationControl(Shell parent, ToolBarManager toolBarManager, IInformationPresenter presenter);
						return DefaultInformationControl.class.getConstructor(Shell.class, ToolBarManager.class,
								IInformationPresenter.class)
								.newInstance(shell, toolBarManager, new HtmlTextPresenter());
					} catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {
						// no way with 3.3 to get V_SCROLL and a ToolBarManager
						return new DefaultInformationControl(shell, SWT.RESIZE, SWT.V_SCROLL | SWT.H_SCROLL,
								new HtmlTextPresenter());
					} catch (Exception e) {
						throw new IllegalStateException(e);
					}
				}
			};
			
The code is tricky, ugly, and error-prone.  Furthermore you can't use reflection to call a superclass constructor.</thetext>

&gt; Steffen, could you comment which 3.4 feature you are planning to use?

You can find enhancements that are pending for Eclipse 3.4 by looking for the [e3.4] tag in our Bugzilla. In the long run we would like to take advantage of these 3.4 features:

222429: [e3.4] use colored label decorations in the Task List
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=222429

237042: [e3.4] use secure storage to save passwords
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=237042

In addition we use "// TODO e3.4 ..." comments in the code to mark pending refactorings (see David's comment 2).

    <thetext>I am in favor of discontinuing Eclipse 3.3 support with the next Mylyn 3.3. release. Users on Eclipse 3.3 will be able to run on the 3.2.x stream for a while until they migrate to Eclipse 3.4 or later. All major Eclipse distributions have a 3.4 based version as far as I know.</thetext>

    <thetext>Build ID: M20070921-1145

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Connect to a trac server at an https URL (that uses a self-signed SSL cert)
2. Enter username and password
3. Click on "Validate Settings"
4. It'll say "No Trac repository at URL"
5. Tick open "Additional Settings"
6. Try XML-RPC.
7. Click on "validate settings"
8. See the message: No Trac repository found at url: I/O error while communicating with HTTP server: Received fatal alert: bad_record_mac
9. Try Web
10. Click on "validate settings"
11. See the message:  No Trac repository found at url: Received fatal alert: bad_record_mac


More information:
This (bad_record_mac) is a common problem with HTTPClient, as far as I can tell. There's no built in way to import the ssl certificate, and, as far as I can tell, there's no cert repository that is used by httpclient (I've tried to import the site's cert using the Java Control Panel, with no luck).

I've read that it's possible to use HTTPClient in such a way that it does allow self-signed certs somehow, but I'm not completely sure how to do this.

By the way, I see the same error message with Subclipse if I use the "pure Java" SVN client, and so must use the the "JavaHL" JNI interface to the native svn client.</thetext>

OK, your site does work for me. I wonder why the site I'm using is failing, then? svn commandline and firefox both load the site up fine. 

BTW, our site does _not_ allow anonymous access. Every connection must be authenticated.

Is there anything I can do to provide better debugging details?</thetext>

We're running an apache2 server with just SSLv3 enabled (this is from our apache2 conf for the ssl site:
        SSLEngine on
        ...
        SSLProtocol -all +SSLv3
        SSLCipherSuite SSLv3:+HIGH:+MEDIUM

I can switch add in SSLv2 and see what happens to Mylyn.</thetext>

If I change this to 
          SSLProtocol -all +SSLv2 +TLSv1

and mylyn works.

So I guess this bug could be retitled to, "Mylyn does not support SSLv3 encryption for https" or similar.

    <thetext>Thanks for verifying. I can reproduce that problem with our server when I only enable SSLv3. 

Mylyn relies on the JDK for its SSL support. Which operating system and java version are you using?

If I add this line to SslProtocolSocketFactory.createSocket() it works (disabling TLSv1 support):

 ((SSLSocket)socket).setEnabledProtocols(new String[] { "SSLv3", "SSLv2Hello" });

Rob, any thoughts? We could potentially detect the exception and try a different protocol set as a fallback?</thetext>

Just going back over this bug due to the recent comment. that should read
"SSLProtocol -all +SSLv3 +TLSv1"

In other words, the client required the server to be serving https with TLSv1.

SSLv2 needn't be supported, but SSLv3 probably should work out of the box, no?</thetext>

HI all,

Adding my voice : we use a hosted svn/trac service. Just a few days ago, this host upgraded apache to 2.2.14. For some reason, this upgrade has force him to force sslv3 only. This has broken my Mylin/Trac connection, with the exact same description as posted by the OP (in 2007!).
I am not sure however this has to do with jre (jre6 here), as I can browse and commit to our svn repo on the very same server.

Any suggestion, things I could try, information I can look for ?

Thanks and best regards</thetext>

    <thetext>... a better solution might be: Server-wise configuration of SSL options in the Mylyn Preferences section (Window-&gt;Preferences). There, one could configure SSLv3-only servers.

I could do that and provide a patch, if you promise to commit it :-)</thetext>

    <thetext>Yes, we could a (per task repository) configuration option although I would prefer not to expose technical details of this sort to users. On the other hand, Firefox and Chrome allow configuration of the supported protocols and only select SSL v3 and TLS v1 by default.

Andre, I would consider accepting a patch that added the configuration UI in a well hidden place and preferably did the right thing during validation. I'll bring this up on the next Mylyn meeting to get some feedback from other committers.</thetext>

&gt; No, the work has not been started, yet. Andre, would you be interested in
&gt; providing a patch for the changes proposed in comment 16?

Yes, I am interested.

Let's discuss the best way to do that.

There are three parts of the patch:
1. Socket creation changes
2. Handling the SSLException and changing SSL configuration data automatically
3. Configuration UI changes for host wise management of the SSLv3 option

1. Socket creation changes
-----------------------------
Focusing on the Bugzilla client, I see that HTTP(S) communication is handled by the class org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.net.WebUtil. WebUtil uses org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.commons.net.PollingSslProtocolSocketFactory for SSL connections. In order to configure the socket to use SSLv3 only, I need to use my own SocketFactory.

I propose the following change:

org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.net.AbstractWebLocation:
New method "isSslv3Only(): boolean", default implementation: return false

org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.core.TaskRepositoryLocation:
Overwrites "isSslv3Only(): boolean": gets the information from TaskRepository

org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.core.TaskRepository:
New property (Key: "org.eclipse.mylyn.tasklist.repositories.sslv3only")
New methods (get/set)Sslv3Only

org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.net.WebUtil.createHostConfiguration:
If SSL and location.isSslv3Only(), use alternative SocketFactory, which configures the socket correctly using "socket.setEnabledProtocols(new String[] {"SSLv3"})"

2. Handling the SSLException and changing SSL configuration data automatically
-----------------------------
I don't know, how to do that. The exception could be caught in WebUtil.executeInternal, but I see no reasonable way to access configuration data from there. Please help me on that.

3. Configuration UI changes for host wise management of the SSLv3 option
-----------------------------
org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.ui.preferences.TasksUiPreferencePage:
Use TaskRepositoryManager (TasksUIPlugin.getRepositoryManager()) to set SSLv3 options (TaskRepository.setSslv3Only - see above)

&gt; Let's discuss the best way to do that.
&gt; 
&gt; There are three parts of the patch:
&gt; 1. Socket creation changes
&gt; 2. Handling the SSLException and changing SSL configuration data automatically
&gt; 3. Configuration UI changes for host wise management of the SSLv3 option
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Socket creation changes
&gt; -----------------------------
&gt; Focusing on the Bugzilla client, I see that HTTP(S) communication is handled by
&gt; the class org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.net.WebUtil. WebUtil uses
&gt; org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.commons.net.PollingSslProtocolSocketFactory for SSL
&gt; connections. In order to configure the socket to use SSLv3 only, I need to use
&gt; my own SocketFactory.

The changes should be applied to PollingSslProtocolSocketFactory since that's already used by all connectors.

&gt; I propose the following change:
&gt; 
&gt; org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.net.AbstractWebLocation:
&gt; New method "isSslv3Only(): boolean", default implementation: return false
&gt; 
&gt; org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.core.TaskRepositoryLocation:
&gt; Overwrites "isSslv3Only(): boolean": gets the information from TaskRepository

How about a more flexible type such as or enum in case we want to support other protocol combinations in the future?

&gt; org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.core.TaskRepository:
&gt; New property (Key: "org.eclipse.mylyn.tasklist.repositories.sslv3only")
&gt; New methods (get/set)Sslv3Only

It should be sufficient to declare a new property key without the need for adding new methods.
 
&gt; org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.net.WebUtil.createHostConfiguration:
&gt; If SSL and location.isSslv3Only(), use alternative SocketFactory, which
&gt; configures the socket correctly using "socket.setEnabledProtocols(new String[]
&gt; {"SSLv3"})"

Couldn't this be directly implemented in PollingSslProtocolSocketFactory?

&gt; 2. Handling the SSLException and changing SSL configuration data automatically
&gt; -----------------------------
&gt; I don't know, how to do that. The exception could be caught in
&gt; WebUtil.executeInternal, but I see no reasonable way to access configuration
&gt; data from there. Please help me on that.

I think this would need to be handled in BugzillaRepositorySettingsPage.validate() to be able to do the proper exception handling. Once this works for one connector we can put a generic implementation in AbstractRepositorySettingsPage.

&gt; 3. Configuration UI changes for host wise management of the SSLv3 option
&gt; -----------------------------
&gt; org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.ui.preferences.TasksUiPreferencePage:
&gt; Use TaskRepositoryManager (TasksUIPlugin.getRepositoryManager()) to set SSLv3
&gt; options (TaskRepository.setSslv3Only - see above)

Yes, it's good if we keep this simple for now, with two selections for either default or SSLv3 maybe.</thetext>

    <thetext>Sorry for the delay.

Before jumping in the code any further, I wanted to look, how other Eclipse plugins handle SSL sockets. SVNKit for example works with SSLv3 servers out of the box. That is because in the SVNKit SVNSocketFactory, there is a statement

((SSLSocket) sslSocket).setEnabledProtocols(new String[] {"SSLv3"});

for every SSL socket. If a wide used library like SVNKit does that, we shouldn't we? It seams to be valid for old non SSLv3 server, too, right? I think, the JRE automatically switches back to SSLv2 etc.

Could someone verify, if setting enabled protocols to SSLv3 is backwards compatible to non SSLv3 server?</thetext>

    <thetext>I added support for a new system property that allows overriding of the enabled protocols for SSL sockets: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn/FAQ#System_Properties . 

If you set this system property in the eclipse.ini you can limit support to SSLv3 to work around the problem described in this bug: -Dorg.eclipse.mylyn.https.protocols=SSLv3

The problem is also described in the following FAQ entry: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn/FAQ#Error_.22Received_fatal_alert:_bad_record_mac.22_when_using_https .

This property will be supported in the next weekly build.</thetext>

    <thetext>The current infrastructure doesn't seem to report upload progress when adding an attachment to a task. Looking at AbstractTaskAttachmentSource the code seems designed for progress reporting but neither TaskAttachmentPartSource nor any of the concrete TaskAttachmentSource classes seem to make any use of it.

I got some quite good results with the attached code. The only issue it has is that the monitor handed to me trough AbstractTaskAttachmentHandler seems to use only about a third of the ticks of the parent monitor. So the visual effect is that the progress bar steadily moving form 0% to 33% and the suddenly jumping to 100%. Four fifths or even nine tenths of the ticks would probably yield much better results.</thetext>

    <thetext>That's a good suggestion. I am a bit torn if that is the best approach to monitoring the progress for attachment uploads though since the overall request that is sent to the server will always have more data. I'll have to look at HttpClient more closely to check if there is a way to hook the monitor in the sending/receiving process, e.g. through a custom request entity.</thetext>

    <thetext>There are a couple of issues that need fixing, either in the MediaWiki source or in the WikiText parser:

* In the user guide source there is a comment that starts with @&lt;!---@ and ends with @---&gt;@: these should be modified as follows: @&lt;!--@ and @--&gt;@ (one less '-')
* Some lines in the user guide start with a single space.  According to the MediaWiki documentation this indicates preformatted text.  Either the user guide source should be updated, or perhaps we're detecting these cases incorrectly in the WikiText parser.
* Links are problematic.  In the user guide we link using [[Mylyn FAQ]] and [[Mylyn_FAQ]], but WikiText is resolving this to http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn/Mylyn_FAQ when in fact it should be http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn/FAQ.  I'm not sure if this is a bug with WikiText or a problem with the way the links are expressed in the user guide.
* There are a few broken images</thetext>

    <thetext>Please feel free to fix any errors like the malformed HTML comments or the extraneous spaces.

Regarding the FAQ [[Mylyn FAQ]], [[Mylyn_FAQ]] and [[Mylyn/FAQ]] should all be valid links. The page was originally located at Mylyn_FAQ but later moved to Mylyn/FAQ and is now a redirect. It seems that MediaWiki replaces spaces by underscores in internal links. We can standardize on a single convention for linking (e.g. [[Mylyn/FAQ]]) if that helps</thetext>

that makes sense to me now.  

The [[Mylyn/FAQ]] link looks like it would be the best option.  Or would just [[FAQ]] work?  

Is there a way to test out these changes without making them instantly 'live' and visible to everyone?

    <thetext>I've made some minor changes to the online User Guide of Mylyn as follows:

&gt; * In the user guide source there is a comment that starts with @&lt;!---@ and ends
&gt; with @---&gt;@: these should be modified as follows: @&lt;!--@ and @--&gt;@ (one less
&gt; '-')

fixed

&gt; * Some lines in the user guide start with a single space.  According to the
&gt; MediaWiki documentation this indicates preformatted text.

fixed

also in several areas &lt;code&gt; tags were present before preformatted text, which resulted in malformed XML as follows

bc.. 
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
...
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

p. removed these &lt;code&gt; tags.

Also updated build-helper.xml to validate generated eclipse help (HTML ) content to verify that it's all well-formed XML, so that we don't see runtime errors when viewing the help (Eclipse parses these files at runtime)</thetext>

I've taken a look and [[Mylyn/FAQ]] looks to be the best option for WikiText.  It will make it easy to detect links that are in a specific space in the wiki.

Updated all Mylyn internal wiki links to use the [[Mylyn/Page_Name]] convention.  Tested these links, looks good.  Generated Eclipse help content now resolves these links correctly.

Sorry, I missed that comment. To clarify, I was just referring to the Mylyn user guide. I think we should take at least one pass through the contents to make sure the guide does not contain false information before redistributing it as part of the Mylyn help plug-in.

Mik, are you okay with committing the current state of the Mylyn user guide to cvs?</thetext>

I see your point, but we should also consider that users still have access to that content.  In fact, they're pointed to it from the current Mylyn help plug-in.

    <thetext>Links to non-eclipse.org content

Occasionally, you may want or need to provide links to external content from your project website. Several projects do this today: it's an excellent way to provide more information for your project, and help to make your project become part of the community. Some projects link to websites that showcase how the project's code is being used by the community, some to FAQs and other sources of information.

The content on the Eclipse website and wiki is subject to the Eclipse Terms of Use [1]. Information, downloads, and other kinds of information found on other websites are likely subject to different terms of use. In consideration of this, it is critical that your project's consumers are made explicitly aware of where the Eclipse project's website ends and the third-party site begins.

You can provide links from your Eclipse project's web site to external resources (e.g. binaries, code, etc.), provided that:

   1. There is some adequate disclaimers that make it clear that although this is a "related link" that this is not Eclipse content.
   2. The link to the existing code is not just be a direct link to content. It has to be a link to a download page on the external site.
   3. The link to their download page needs to be such that it brings up an entirely new browser so that it is made even more apparent to the user that they are leaving the eclipse.org website.

    <thetext>"Tasks User Guide" might still be mis-named.  Feel free to move it to top-level for now, but I want us to review this before the 3.2 release in case we want to bring things back into a single, more generic, top-level node.</thetext>

    <thetext>Background for this is on bug 281893.  Since we have a mechanism for detecting when the user is interacting with Eclipse, we can use that to improve the sync policy.  The main thing that would be nice to avoid is the unnecessary syncs when the user is away from the computer for a long time (eg, overnight, on vacation) but the computer is on.  We need to do this in a way that doesn't degrade user experience in a significant way.  Draft proposal, assuming our default 20min sync interval:
* If 20min have elapsed since last sync, and user has not been active during that interval, enable the "inactive user sync mode.
* In this mode, do the sync, but schedule the next sync for 2x the period of the last sync (ie, 40min, then 80min, then 160min, ...).
* If user becomes active, disable the inactive mode.  Kick off sync immediately to "catch up".</thetext>

    <thetext>I have implemented the policy as described. The synchronization interval triples with every sync as long as the user stays inactive.

I noticed the following weirdness while debugging: If no task is ever activated a magic property in ContextUiPlugin.lazyStart() is never set and monitoring in ActivityContextManager is never enabled:

			MonitorUiPlugin.getDefault()
					.getPreferenceStore()
					.setValue(MonitorUiPlugin.PREF_USER_ACTIVITY_ENABLED, true);

While that might have been intentional I am not sure that still makes sense now that the monitoring is used for other purposes than time tracking. The preferences need to be at least saved otherwise the user needs to activate a task on each start.

Shawn, can you review the patch?</thetext>

    <thetext>The patch looks good to me.  The only thing that I am a bit concerned about is how easy it is to become inactive and have a single sync go by, but I think that the way that you handled resetting the delay and running the sync if needed should mitigate any worries that I have.  It seems like you find for the MonitorUiPlugin initialization fixes the auto save context bug (bug 219173).</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks Shawn. If you go inactive that next sync will still happen and only if you stay inactive for the entire tripled interval will the next sync get delayed for a long time.</thetext>

    <thetext>Mylyn is the task and application lifecycle management (ALM) framework for Eclipse. It provides the revolutionary task-focused interface, a task management tool for developers and a broad ecosystem of Agile and ALM integrations. For Helios the Mylyn project is continuing to evolve its APIs and framework to keep up with ti with its rate of adoption. Major improvements in the Helios release:

* The scheduled Task List presentation now displays incoming and outgoing tasks providing a streamlined view for planning and scheduling.
* WikiText generates integrated Eclipse Help from a set of MediaWiki pages, enabling a crowdsourcing approach to documenting Eclipse features.
* The CDT bridge has been updated, improved and moved from initial prototype in the CDT project to be the second reference implementation for focus in the Mylyn project.
* The Bugzilla connector now supports up to Bugzilla 3.6.</thetext>

Subject: [eclipse.org-planning-council] New Intro feature that Europa Components will find useful
...
I'd like to draw your attention to new functionality which we in the User Assistance team added in M7 which is of particular interest to Europa developers. This is solution to the perennial problem where a user installs a new feature but then doesn't know how to find the information which will help him get started using that feature. Here's the text from M7 New and Noteworthy: 

The first time Eclipse is restarted after installing plug-ins containing new Universal Intro content, the Welcome screen will open on a page which prominently shows the new content. In the example below a plug-in (created using the PDE Universal Intro template) was installed before Eclipse was restarted. 

We encourage teams to take advantage of this capability as a way of pointing the user at useful information about how to use their newly installed features/plugins/components.  Creating a plugin with universal intro content, or modifying and existing plugin is easy if you use the PDE template, instructions on how to do this are at http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-ua/documents/intro_3_3_features.html.</thetext>

  Tutorial Short description: Learn how to report a bug to Eclipse Bugzilla.
  Tutorial Content: A cheat sheet which uses the Help/Report bug function.

Later the tutorials section will be updated, as soon as the cheat sheets are 

finished.


* Samples section:
  I think this section could be empty.


* What's new section:
  Title: Mylar
  Short description: Find out about the significant changes made to Mylar
  Content: "New and noteworthy" from http://www.eclipse.org/mylar/doc/new.php.

If this list is proper, I will make a patch.</thetext>

    <thetext>This sounds like a very good first pass Balazs.  I suggest that you make a patch which has *very* short overviews of the content, e.g. a sentence for each section.  Then commit that as a patch and we can come up with content on this bug.  

Agreed that the samples section should be empty for now.  

Regarding the New &amp; Noteworthy, should we copy the content into org.eclipse.mylar.doc (we used to have it there) or can we just point to the web-based new &amp; noteworthy?  Fyi the file is mylar/doc/new.html (see integrator ref for checking out the web site from CVS).

Regarding the tutorials, I think that the following two are key:

1) Getting started with Task Repositories.  Add a query to bugs.eclipse.org for all Mylar P1 and P2 enhancements.  This is one of the challenges of getting started, many users won't have a bug to submit, and once they have the repository set up it's quite straightforward to submit bugs.

2) Getting started with the Task-Focused UI.  This will show them how to activate a task, click the focus button, Alt+click, and switch tasks.</thetext>

    <thetext>Patch applied, great stuff Balazs!  Some comments:

1) Make the "Add Task Repository Step" sound optional before "Create a New Query", because we already automatically add the Eclipse.org repository.  However, it would be useful to have a step to prompt users to set the credentials for that repository (repository page now has a hyperlink for doing that).

2) It would help to simplify the "Use Task Focused UI" steps some.  First, do not suggest to switch to the PDE perspective because we try not to favor particular perspectives.  Open Task List view should be executable.  Then, instead of having the user create a new project, you could get them to activate a task and then do an "Open Type" on a Java type that they have in an existing project (or suggest creating a project if they don't).  Then the key thing to get them to do is to toggle the Focus button on the Package Explorer (you can probably make that executable too) and to get them to Alt+click when toggled (since it takes a while for users to learn this).  

Another thing I'm wondering is if we should really be redistributing the New &amp; Noteworthy.  We used to do this, but the online documentation has been working better.  What do you think?</thetext>

    <thetext>I will do the modifications.

We can use the online New &amp; Noteworthy, but when I made the local page I followed the "general" eclipse style.
If we use the online version I would like to use it as a local version, in the help system. I wouldn't like to use a simple link which opens in a web browser.
If we choose the "general" version I can write a small shell script to make the rewriting faster.

manifest.mf contains o.e.webapp depencies

Sorry I forgot to add the org.eclipse.help.webapp to the plugin dependencies. You need o.e.help, o.e.help.ui, o.e.help.base, o.e.webapp and org.mortbay.jetty to use the help. Only the webapp isn't added automatically. 
I attach the modified manifest.mf file. I hope this will be working.</thetext>

    <thetext>Balazs: could you please make the changes to the manifest file a patch?

Regarding the New &amp; Noteworthy, I'm fine with embedding it since it does make sense to link from Welcome.  We have a script for copying over the contents in /cvsroot/org.eclipse/www/mylar/build.xml so please update it to copy the contents in the way that you use them.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks for pointing that out, I was wondering where that extension point was actually used. I have added the extensions.

As discussed on today's call I'm moving this bug to the next milestone. There are too many blanks in the current documentation to make it worth while publishing the generated Javadoc or extension point documentation at this point. Once the documentation has been improved we can reconsider including the plug-in in the SDK feature.</thetext>

    <thetext>While implementing this I could not quite figure out what the best user interaction when validating a repository that redirects to another location (e.g. https:// instead of http://):

 1) show a selection dialog displaying alternative locations ("Keep my location", "Use redirect location")
 2) replace url in dialog and display a warning [current implementation]

location dialog

I have implemented a dialog that prompts the user if the repository location does not match (see attached snap shot). We can iterate for the next release how to improve the interaction.

I have also changed the logging of login errors to only be active when the repository is being validated to avoid polluting the Eclipse error log.</thetext>

    <thetext>I have changed the wording to "Keep current location:".

We should consider making this part of the repository settings API. Bugzilla displays a modal error dialog when attempting to validate http://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs instead of following the redirect to https://...

Marking as resolved.

    <thetext>There could be potentially three urls:

- the user provided one
- the one returned by getServerInfo().getBaseURL()
- the one the redirects during web login pointed to

We could replace the radio buttons by a combo box. Another idea I had was to add them to the combo box in the repository settings dialog but I'd rather prioritize other bugs and push this to the next release.</thetext>

    <thetext>+1 for the prioritization suggested in comment#8.

I actually prefer the radio buttons to a combo box because they show the entire text for both options.  Fyi in Vista this kind of UI is standard and I find it works very well.  But instead of Radios they make large hyperlink-style buttons with text that you can click, reducing the click count from 2 to 1.</thetext>

    <thetext>No plans to do so,  iwas just pointing out some similarity with something that is working well in the Vista UI.  Btw, visually they really look like hyperlinks, just act a bit like them (e.g. parts of text underline on hover).  </thetext>

    <thetext>Something is seriously wrong with this implementation. There are number of severe usability issues in the last dev build that didn't exist before:

-- I've got asked user and password for the same jira repository about 10 times or so
-- I've got asked for the passwords for repositories that I have no tasks (just checked checked the Archive category using "group by repository")
-- password dialog doesn't say anywhere that the password is for the jira repository and it doesn't show any branding and that is very confusing
-- when I enter the password I have no way to verify if password is correct. the "verify" button on the task repository dialog is very useful and we should provide it on the password dialog too.</thetext>

    <thetext> (In reply to comment #4)
&gt; -- I've got asked user and password for the same jira repository about 10 times
&gt; or so

Did you enter the correct password? You will be prompted again when you enter the wrong password (and do not hit cancel).

&gt; -- I've got asked for the passwords for repositories that I have no tasks (just
&gt; checked checked the Archive category using "group by repository")

Do you have automatic synchronization enabled? Please see the description for bug 208333.

&gt; -- password dialog doesn't say anywhere that the password is for the jira
&gt; repository and it doesn't show any branding and that is very confusing

Jup, that could be improved. The CVS password dialog does not have much branding either but it would certainly help to add the appropriate repository icon to the password dialog.

&gt; -- when I enter the password I have no way to verify if password is correct. the
&gt; "verify" button on the task repository dialog is very useful and we should
&gt; provide it on the password dialog too.

If you enter the wrong password the password dialog will come up again. No need for a verification button.

How do I know if I didn't? There isn't any error or warning.

&gt; Do you have automatic synchronization enabled? Please see the description for
&gt; bug 208333.

Yes I do have automatic sync enabled and yet that is not a reason to ask for the password. The password request should be happening when server request goes out, but not when "maybe server request will be made"

&gt; If you enter the wrong password the password dialog will come up again. No need
&gt; for a verification button.

There is a very big need in "verify", unless reappearing dialog will clearly communicate that password is invalid, or there is some other kind of error happens.</thetext>

The behavior is consistent with the CVS plug-in. The password dialog is displayed when authentication fails and displays a message: "Please enter repository password". If it was unclear to you what you were supposed to do, please make suggestions for improvements.

I am saying that this implementation breaks user experience that we had before. Dialog jumps out of nowhere (even if you already trying to edit password for the same repository) and dialog don't provide clear user feedback. Repeating things I've said in my previous comments:

-- password dialog should have "validate" button similar to repository properties
-- password dialog should provide a clear error message, i.e. "invalid user user credentials", or "missing user credentials", or "auth failed"
-- one more that haven't been mentioned before. If user is on the repository properties dialog, password dialog should not popup.

Also, it doesn't matter that dialog is consistent with CVS, the one from CVS is also nowhere close to be usable.</thetext>

&gt; Dialog jumps out of nowhere (even if you already trying to edit password for the

We could consider only triggering the prompt if a repository connection was initiated by the user.

&gt; -- one more that haven't been mentioned before. If user is on the repository
&gt; properties dialog, password dialog should not popup.

That is a minor problem with the current implementation and the user always has the possibility to hit "Cancel" to continue editing in the repository properties dialog. I am against suppressing the password popup but the repository settings dialog could update to the credentials entered in the password dialog.

Need more input.</thetext>

    <thetext>I haven't been able to reproduce this problem. Please try these steps:

- close the editor
- synchronize task from task list
- open task in editor

That should display the correct operations for the issue.

    <thetext>Sorry, I should have made this more clear: When synchronizing queries and synchronizing from the editor cached information will be used. Please close the editor and use "Synchronize" from the context menu of the task list on the task (not on the query) and then reopen the editor. 

We will address synchronizing from the editor to force a refresh in the next release.</thetext>

    <thetext>Karsten, if the bug state is changed outside of Mylyn and is only updated by automatic query synchronization the operations will not update. The reason is that this information is not included in the RSS feed and only available through an expensive SOAP call.

I'll add a check for a changed status and trigger an update in that case which should fix the problem.</thetext>

    <thetext>The JIRA connector uses the EditIssue page to submit changes to the repository. Some users only have permissions to add comments that need to be posted through the AddComments page. This needs to be detected properly.

From bug 174925 comment 2:

I have the same problem too. But in my case comments will be never transmitted, either by changing status nor by leave as is.
I tried it with Jira 3.7.2 and Jira 3.8.</thetext>

    <thetext>From bug 189209 comment 41:

First of all list of available operations don't available to guests and I just catching exception there. So, still need to test how comment posting is working on projects at the codehaus and spring jira trackers.

From bug 189209 comment 42:

It should work when you use JiraClient.addCommentToIssue() instead of JiraClient.updateIssue().</thetext>

    <thetext>JiraTaskDataHandler uses HTML2TextReader to convert HTML returned by the RSS reader to text. This conversion is specific to the RSS feed and should be done in RssContentHandler.

    <thetext>Btw, when I added that HTML2TextReader I was wondering if it should go somewhere more generic than JIRA.  It shold be coming from Platform but they have several copies of it as well and none in a good spot.

This class can't be moved into any core plug-in though, because it unfortunately depends on SWT and JFace.</thetext>

    <thetext>Yes, I had this same thought when adding this functionality and knew it was going into the wrong place (I may have noted that in the code).  This is a presentation level thing, e.g. at some point we might want to do things like presenting the HTML markup as StyledText.

So what if we make the task editor strip the HTML when presenting?  That way we could also have a mode for the task editor where we get it to use the browser widget for rendering comments, and maybe later StyledText (so that we can continue to support proper Java Stack Trace links).</thetext>

    <thetext>Steffen, I don't think that changes made for this issue are really good idea, unless you have something else in mind. For instance, the following method in the RssContentHandler:

	private String getCurrentElementTextEscapeHtml() {
		String unescaped = currentElementText.toString();
		unescaped = unescaped.replaceAll("\n", "");
		unescaped = unescaped.replaceAll("&lt;br/&gt;", "\n");
		unescaped = unescaped.replaceAll("&amp;nbsp;", " ");
		unescaped = StringEscapeUtils.unescapeXml(unescaped);
		return unescaped;
	}

is changing text retrieved from the rss, so now we don't anymore have rendered html text from the jira, not original text. So it doesn't seem like change you made is playing in a favor for using jira headless api for working with jira tasks.</thetext>

    <thetext>I am not sure you understand the escaping used by the RSS feed that is returned by the server. That is why I asked you to review my test cases. The code you quoted in comment 11 simply unescapes the RSS feed restoring the HTML returned by the server. Once again, please provide a test case that demonstrates that the HTML is not restored correctly. Before my changes the HTML was converted to some garbled representation that was intermingled with StyledText markup (see bug   190852). </thetext>

test case showing problem with last changes

Steffen, I don't know if you are trying to give me the hard time or really don't see the obvious issue. 

Here is the failed test case as you requested. It shows rss reader does not produce exactly formatted html and certain things are lost during parsing, for example line breaks inside &lt;pre&gt; tags.</thetext>

    <thetext>The escaping used by the RSS feed is different depending on whether Wiki markup is enabled or not. Here is the XML for http://mylyn.eclipse.org/jira-enterprise-3.9/browse/SCRATCH-194:

&lt;description&gt;line 1

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;line 3&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/description&gt;

&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
line 3&lt;/environment&gt;

Markup is enabled for description but not for environment. The current JIRA connector implementation only works correctly if markup is not enabled. That is known and tracked on bug 190852.</thetext>

    <thetext>Steffen, the test case I created per your request is showing parsing of the rss returned by jira with markup enabled. So I am still interested to hear an explanation why you think it is a good idea to modify data from the server in a way that can't be reversed (that is breaking the data).

It doesn't really matter if markup is on or off, and I would say that the data should be stored in the way as returned from server. Then it is up to the JIRA UI how to visualize data and that is what bug 190852 should be taking care of.

If you think about it, JIRA connector can be retrieving hundreds issues, then those issues should be available at least for viewing offline. It seems a logical choice to keep the ready-to-use html at least for viewing. Am I missing something?</thetext>

    <thetext>I agree with the points you made in comment 19 but I am under the impression that you have either not read my comments or I have not expressed myself clearly. Quoting bug 190852 comment 10:

If rich-text rendering is enabled for the repository that [XML] representation only provides rendered HTML but not the original markup. That means it will be necessary to use either a SOAP or XML-RPC call to get the source markup.

The most important use case that needs to be supported is to retrieve, edit and submit an issue. If markup is not enabled JIRA escapes line breaks with &lt;br/&gt;\n and spaces with &amp;nbsp; for certain fields. In order to submit these fields back to the repository the text needs to be unescaped. That is what the code quoted in comment  11 does and other code did before my refactoring. This is validated by test cases and necessary to make the connector work at all.

The problems are:

- If markup is enabled for a field (e.g. description or environment) the RSS feed does not return the source but a rendered version of the source. We currently have no way to submit such an issue without causing changes to those fields (see bug 190852). This is a bug.
 
- Unfortunately the escaping is differently when markup is enabled causing the HTML to be mangled but I am currently not concerned about that for 2 reasons:

 - Mylyn does not support rendering of HTML for JIRA making the HTML unreadable with line breaks or without line breaks. Supporting that is not a priority for Mylyn 2.3.

 - The RSS feed does not indicate which type of escaping is used. If you can suggest a reliable method of detecting enabled markup we can skip unescaping of line breaks for those fields. Supporting that is not a priority for Mylyn 2.3 either. 

It is priority to support markup in a way that it does not "break" when submitting issues. I have suggested accordant changes on bug 190852 comment 10 . You have already voiced disagreement with these priorities on bug 190852 so I suggest that you add this as an item to next weeks agenda.</thetext>

    <thetext>I don't know about existing test cases, but I believe it is possible to detect if html have markup or not. The latter probably won't have html tags other then &lt;br/&gt;.

BTW, what was your intention with unescaped.replaceAll("&lt;br/&gt;\n", "\n"); in RssContentHandler.getCurrentElementTextEscapeHtml() method? I probably wouldn't have to guess, if there was a low level unit test covering that method.</thetext>

Eugene: this comment is unfair.  Steffen did not break any feature or create any regression, he is clearly using his common sense and his best understanding of how to prioritize this work.  I realize that you have a different point of view on it, but it's far from clear to me whether your point of view and arguments will make for a better prioritization of the current problems with the connector, and your arguments have not taken his points into account and are not entirely constructive.  Yes, we are in a challenging state with where markup and information loss, and I agree with Steffen's approach to preserving as much information as possible and leaving the rendering/editing/transformation to the UI layer.</thetext>

&gt; Eugene: this comment is unfair.  Steffen did not break any feature or create any
&gt; regression, he is clearly using his common sense and his best understanding of...

My interpretation is that existing feature been indeed broken, and my attempts to get better understanding what Sfeffen's line of thoughts was when doing that wasn't too successful. See comments #11, #12 and #13.

&gt; how to prioritize this work.  I realize that you have a different point of view
&gt; on it, but it's far from clear to me whether your point of view and arguments
&gt; will make for a better prioritization of the current problems with the

&gt; information as possible and leaving the rendering/editing/transformation to the

That is the problem. Steffen's approach is *NOT* preserving "as much as possible information", it is stripping significant information and that is what I've been arguing about in last 10 comments or so. I even provided a unit test to demonstrate that, but for some reason my unit test been disregarded.

Maybe I am still misunderstanding something, but Steffen's responses to my questions wasn't really helping to remove that misunderstanding.</thetext>

    <thetext>Need to reopen. It turns out that the current conversion method is too simple to properly reverse the HTML added by the RSS feed:

 - links are converted to &lt;a... tags
 
Unfortunately the way line breaks are formatted by the server can differ depending on whether an issue is submitted by Mylyn or by the web-interface. RSS feed for line-ending:

 - web submission: \r&lt;br/&gt;\n\r
 - task editor submission: &lt;br/&gt;\n\r

That will need additional test coverage.</thetext>

    <thetext>Could you clarify what UI layer means in this context (i.e. JiraTaskEditor or JiraTaskDataHandler which is in the UI plug-in but I consider it part of the core)? 

My goal is to move all lossy data conversion to the task editor and store the source representation in the task data. Source representation means the data represented in such a way that in can be transmitted back to the repository without causing a change (unless edited obviously).</thetext>

    <thetext>Added detection for markup by scanning for any tag that is not &lt;a&gt; or &lt;br/&gt;. If markup is detected no conversion of the RSS feed is attempted otherwise HTML2TextReader is used to strip &lt;a&gt; and &lt;br/&gt; tags. I would prefer to limit the conversion to those tags and use a simpler conversion class but there is no point in re-implementing the class since it is known to work.</thetext>

    <thetext>Ideally the attachment wizard code would be refactored first (bug 193156). It is a good suggestion though to go for the quick fix now and disable it. That should be straight forward and we can do the proper refactoring for 3.0.</thetext>

    <thetext>Mik, are you talking about something like: Mylar depends on Axis, but Axis needs to access some Mylar classes? (sorry I'm not familiar with Mylar use of Axis)

On this case, wouldn't Eclipse-BuddyPolicy and Eclipse-RegisterBuddy directives resolve this?</thetext>

    <thetext>We tried, but failed to move the Axis depencency into org.eclipse.mylar.  The problem with Axis is that it uses call backs (perhaps Axis2 does not, but we're not there yet).  So my interpretation of what happens is that if the JIRA plug-in tries to load Axis from another plug-in that works, but then the callbacks don't work because the Axis has been loaded by another plug-ins class loader.  So currently we're recommending that connectors maintain their own Axis dependencies.</thetext>

    <thetext>Let's see if I understood: the only dependency on axis is jira.core?

If so, the normal way to do is to separate axis jars on its own bundle and make jira.core depends on it. On this case, axis will be on it own classloader, and jira.core's classloader will see its classes and axis classes.

The problem is that if axis needs to see jira.core's class via callbacks, it will throw some ClassNotFoundExceptions because axis classloader don't see jira.core.

I had this same problem on my products, where I depends on jakarta-commons-digester which have to instantiate my own business classes.

The solution: on axis bundle, declare a "Eclipse-BuddyPolicy: registered" directive on manifest (you have to insert this manually on MANIFEST.MF).

On jira.core bundle, declare a "Eclipse-RegisterBuddy: &lt;axis-bundle-id-here&gt;" directive.

This way you are saying that jira.core bundle is visible to axis's classloader.

Note that these are not standardized OSGI directives (they are prefixed with "Eclipse-") and would work only on equinox.

    <thetext>Thanks for the pointers Willian, I vaguely recall hearing about the buddy policy a while back.  I'm still concerned that we don't want to force a particular version of Axis on connectors by exporting it from ..mylar.core though, because Axis 1.x and Axis2 are so different, and currently we're only approved for Axis 1.3 (1.4 has bug fixes).

    <thetext>It sounds like this method could work as long as Axis was in its own Mylar project so that if there are 2 different versions, the plug-ins don't get confused and attempt to use the incorrect one.  This means that Axis would not be able to reside in org.eclipse.mylar.

I would still need to test this to ensure that it does work.</thetext>

I'd have no idea what it would be, but would be nice to run some scenario that used bot Web Services (in WTP) axis 1.4 function and mylyn axis 1.4 function just to be sure there was no interference.

    <thetext>Thanks David. Now that Mylyn has been orbited I want to get an updated version into the Ganymede nightly builds as soon as possible so we can start integration testing. Axis is certainly one of the tricky bundles when it comes to class loading and it'd be good to work out any problems early in the game :). I have put this on next week's meeting agenda [1] and will post here once a Ganymede distribution with the latest Mylyn 3.0 stream is available: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn/Meetings#Next_Meeting</thetext>

    <thetext>We already ran into an unexpected problem with the Axis dependency of the JIRA connector today: I saw class loading errors when running Mylyn on Java 6 that did not appear when running on Java 5. It turned out that the difference between Java 5 and 6 is that the latter version includes the javax.xml.soap APIs whereas Java 5 does not ship these.

This is what happened:

- org.apache.axis uses the javax.xml.soap.MimeHeaders class which is loaded from the javax.xml.soap bundle
- the jira core plug-in declares an Axis call back that was loading the javax.xml.soap.MimeHeaders class as well
- when org.eclipse.core.runtime is declared before javax.xml as a dependency in the manifest of the jira core plug-in the class is loaded from the system class loader and not from the javax.xml.soap bundle causing the class loaded in the axis bundle to be incompatible with the class loaded by the jira bundle 

The solution was to move the javax.xml.soap dependency in the jira core plug-in dependency "above" the org.eclipse.core.runtime dependency.

David, Kathy, have you run into problems with Orbit bundles where the order of declared dependencies mattered before?</thetext>

&gt; David, Kathy, have you run into problems with Orbit bundles where the order of
&gt; declared dependencies mattered before?
&gt; 

Sure, lots! :) 

Offhand, there's a couple of issues in your description. 1. I think the use of core.runtime is being discourage. Not sure why it's required in this case, but if there's something more specific to pre-req that would be good. 2. Bigger problem: if there is a chance that a package can be in both the JRE and in a plugin (as there is here in this JRE 6 case) then the plugin should "require-bundle" system.bundle ... this allows, the plugin's version of the package to replace ... or "blend in" ... with the one from the JRE. 

So ... javax.xml.soap should be changed to pre-req system.bundle. We've done this in several other bundles, such as xerces for it's "javax.xml" packages. </thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks a lot for the additional information. I was wondering if bundles should prefer to consume packages provided by the JDK from the system class loader. It'd be great if the javax.xml.soap Orbit bundle could be changed accordingly so consumers wouldn't have to worry about the dependency order.

Some of our core plug-ins have activators that extend Plugin which is in core.runtime so I am not sure if we can avoid that dependency entirely. What I don't fully understand, yet, is why the core.runtime bundle loader had the javax.xml.soap.MimeHeaders class. From looking at the bundles and it's re-exported dependencies there didn't seem to be any bundle using the soap package.

I haven't found much documentation about consuming Orbit bundles, e.g. how to integrate Orbit bundles into the headless build or solving class loader problems. Is there a place on the wiki I haven't discovered, yet? I'd be happy to add the experiences gathered from doing this for Mylyn if that helps anyone.</thetext>

I've opened bug 221429 so we won't forget.

Good point ... I dont' see how to do that either. 

&gt; What I
&gt; don't fully understand, yet, is why the core.runtime bundle loader had the
&gt; javax.xml.soap.MimeHeaders class. From looking at the bundles and it's
&gt; re-exported dependencies there didn't seem to be any bundle using the soap
&gt; package.

It doesn't use it directly, but it pre-reqs and (unfortunately) re-exports the 
org.eclipse.osgi bundle. This had to be done for some compatibility reason, but it's this that automatically makes all JRE packages "visible" to plugins. 

&gt; 
&gt; I haven't found much documentation about consuming Orbit bundles, e.g. how to
&gt; integrate Orbit bundles into the headless build or solving class loader
&gt; problems. Is there a place on the wiki I haven't discovered, yet? I'd be happy

    <thetext>Copying description from bug 209610:

Current situation:
If you create a patch to the clipboard and add it to the task, the file is added as clipboard.txt. This is confusing to the commiters that review the patch (all have the same name).

Desired situation:
The patch should be names like bugId_Name.txt, f.e. 207432_20071112.txt.</thetext>

    <thetext>It might also make sense to give the uploading party a choice to name the patch as they would when saving it to the filesystem.

Otherwise picking up version numbers for a series of patches would be nice too. Let's there already exists a patch named:

    <thetext>Eugene, there are more use-cases than applying patches through Mylyn. Even then it is difficult enough to distinguish  different attachments.

Felix, would you be interested in contributing a patch? Most of the relevant code should be in NewAttachmentWizard.

&gt; Eugene, there are more use-cases than applying patches through Mylyn. Even then
&gt; it is difficult enough to distinguish  different attachments.

Steffen, sorry, but that was question to original reporters, but since you answered, can you please list the use cases you are referring to? I am still curious to hear why it is difficult to distinguish attachments in Mylyn Task Editor, which shows attachment date and it author. Thanks.</thetext>

    <thetext>We had issues that had multiple patches addressing several separate concerns in the bug report. Also it is not very convenient to have a meaningless name clipboard.txt suggested as the default when saving the attachment. Moreover the JIRA web ui does not show the date by default. It will only list filenames. Please take a look at this issue for instance that has 13 attachments named clipboard.txt:

    <thetext>After looking at the code for a bit I have a few questions and a few suggestions for refactoring it:

* Implicit dependencies on NewAttachmentWizard in PreviewAttachmentPage. It casts the wizard to this type in createControl.

I'm in favor making the dependency explicit by passing in the right type of Wizard in the constructor, or better rely on the LocalAttachment as model and get the preview contents from there encapsulating where the content comes from.

* Store the type of attachment in LocalAttachment and try to only pass it around between wizard pages if possible. Also remove the file reading in PreviewAttachmentPage and move it into LocalAttachment as an implementation detail, can also cache the contents there, once read.

* Remove checks where InputAttachmentSourcePage.CLIPBOARD_LABEL is used to find out if an attachment is a clipboard attachment.

    <thetext>These suggestions sound great. As long as the involved classes are in internal packages we can make these changes. I'll take a more detailed look later today. Could you attach your context?</thetext>

    <thetext>+1 for using LocalAttachment as a placeholder, but I don't think it is a good idea to put file reading inside that class.

Also before doing these changes it would make sense to finish Willian's patch on bug 195691 which will be conflicting.</thetext>

    <thetext>&gt; Can't attach my context, other projects slipped in and Eclipse hangs whenever I
&gt; try to remove them from the context. I'll file a separate issue for that.

Yes, removing items from the context can cause excessive refresh, please comment on bug 202817 . 

&gt; * Implicit dependencies on NewAttachmentWizard in PreviewAttachmentPage. It
&gt; casts the wizard to this type in createControl.
&gt;
&gt; I'm in favor making the dependency explicit by passing in the right type of
&gt; Wizard in the constructor, or better rely on the LocalAttachment as model and
&gt; get the preview contents from there encapsulating where the content comes from.

That sounds exactly right. Sharing an instance of LocalAttachment between the wizard pages will make this dependency unnecessary.

&gt; * Store the type of attachment in LocalAttachment and try to only pass it around
&gt; between wizard pages if possible. Also remove the file reading in
&gt; PreviewAttachmentPage and move it into LocalAttachment as an implementation
&gt; detail, can also cache the contents there, once read.

That makes sense. Is there a common interface that could be used to abstract access to the data like InputStreams or IStorage?

&gt; * Remove checks where InputAttachmentSourcePage.CLIPBOARD_LABEL is used to find
&gt; out if an attachment is a clipboard attachment.

It would be great if this could abstracted in LocalAttachment.

&gt; * I would only show the "Attachment File Name" field when the attachment comes
&gt; from the clipboard, otherwise the control would not be visible.

I think it would be okay to also show it in the other cases, particularly for JIRA which ignores the description. You can go with the implementation that is easiest and we can iterate on the UI afterwards.  

Felix, don't worry about other contributions conflicting with these changes. I'll take care of the merging if necessary.

    <thetext>Implemented as part of bug 222833. All wizard pages now share a common data model and editing of filenames is enabled for JIRA.

    <thetext>Thomas, please test if the updated SOAP stubs still work with older versions. Doing a "Validate Settings" against JIRA 3.13.1 and 3.4 should be sufficient. Please also check that time tracking still works with JIRA 3.13.1.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks for testing Thomas. I have committed the patch and provided a new weekly build. Thomas, can you install from the weekly update site and test if this works with the latest release? Please resolve this bug if it works. I can't access the updated jars from the EclipseCon mirror at the moment.</thetext>

patch

It seems that the logout does not work correctly. While the two tests introduced with the latest patch work while running on their own, if ran with the testAvailableGetSecurityLevels test the testProjectSecurityLevelNotAccessible will faile (because the securitylevels are in fact set on the project).

Not sure how to solve this here, seems like a lot of work for a minor reason.</thetext>

    <thetext>Interesting suggestions. It is much more readable, especially for repositories with a lot of versions. And it makes better use of the horizontal space.
However it seems to somewhat break with the UI look of the section. The missing borders for an editable field, are (especially if those entries take multiple lines) a bit weird (not sure how it would look with border though, especially since it is non editable). The pencil seems to not fit in the whole look, but that may just be my personal preference. The pencil should however be vertically centered like the label, not stick to the bottom.
Overall, if few versions are selected, it is much more readable. But if a lot of versions are selected, it gets harder (since every version has a different width). The additional dialog might also be considered a regression (since it is not possible to select a version with a single click) - especially in a new (unsubmitted) task this is an issue I would say.

Allmost all my negative points seem to be personal look and feel preferences though, so I think that should be a discussion among more people.

I wonder if, for the sake of quickly seeing what the selected versions are, a tooltip showing that comma separated list, appearing on hover over the existing table would be enough?</thetext>

    <thetext>Well, fixing borders is one line of code. Pencil is at the bottom because I prefer it that way, that's also easy to fix.

I don't think adding a tooltip would be a solution here - users would not know that they have it there. I think that more important here is to have an easily readable form. List was unreadable. That fixes it.

    <thetext>That looks good Pawel. I am unsure about the border. It looks cleaner without it and the pencil should be sufficient to indicate that it's editable. I have added it to the agenda for the next Mylyn meeting to discuss and review the UI. It could make sense to use that same UI for other connectors as well: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn_Meetings#Next_Meeting.

I noticed a few minor problems when I tested the patch: 
* The font is not set to the task editor font.
* Incoming changes are not properly indicated. The blue background should be applied to the whole control (marked in read in the screenshot).

Shawn is currently working on generalizing the keyword selection dialog which has an almost identical UI. I would suggest to wait until bug 279334 is resolved then we can reuse the same code for JIRA and fix up the remaining nits.</thetext>

    <thetext>Pawel, can you refactor the patch to make use of CheckBoxTreeDialog and CheckBoxMultiSelectAttribiteEditor which Shawn added as part of bug 287899?

On a side note, it seems a bit heavy weight to use a RichTextEditor control since neither hyperlinking nor context assist are needed for the version or component selection. Have you considered using a simple Text control instead?</thetext>

    <thetext>&gt; Yes, I did thought about using simpler widget but decided to use RTE as sooner
&gt; or later will add there hyperlink support.

Can you elaborate on the the purpose of the hyperlinking? An RTE is fairly expensive in terms of resources and the hyperlinking support comes with some complexity such as registering a detector. I would consider a more lightweight widget such as Text or Link if clicking components only triggers the selection dialog but does not require extensibility or separate actions for each component.</thetext>

Improved patch

Thanks Steffen for pointing out that Shawn implemented this widget idea into commons. That's great news as this kind of a widget would be usefull in other places.

I'm attaching a newer version using CheckBoxMultiSelectAttributeEditor.

One thing though - I modified CBMSAE to support two important things:

- if user clicks Edit, then OK in the dialog box but doesn't change the task editor will stay in unmodified state (I compare new values to the old ones), originally the editor pointed out changes but it shouldn't in my opionion as nothing was changed

- also if user selects a lot of options text will be cut off (check the screenshot I'll attach), that's unacceptable in my opinion - I added a hack to resize the text widget and the whole section. please implement a proper way to do it that can be re-used in other AttributeEditors</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks Pawel. I have added a call to reflow the form when the size of the text field changes. This is necessary to properly update the scroll bars of the form. 

There is some potential for improving the edit UI, e.g. by using a tooltip-like shell without a title for selecting items instead of the modal dialog. We could also consider replacing the Edit button by an icon that only shows on hover. Most JIRA editors will have three additional buttons now for Affects Versions, Fix Versions and Components which I find looks a bit cluttered.</thetext>

    <thetext>I've tested out the latest changes, and they're excellent.  It's much easier to see what's selected when there's a long list of items.  Also the presentation is more compact.

Any chance of having a 'clear' button in the pop-up dialog that deselects all items?  When there are many items (eg: 100's) it's a pain to have to scroll through them all to deselect one or two items.</thetext>

    <thetext>Good stuff.  Thanks for the attachments David.  Here's the UI review feedback from the Mylyn call, Steffen can elaborate:
* Make the keyword a border-less shell (similar to an InfoPopupDialog) and have it appear below the Edit button.
* Retain the current layout, including the filter text box.
* Retain the OK/Cancel buttons for now, we could consider getting rid of them later.</thetext>

    <thetext>Not sure how the dev process looks like here, but wasn't this issue marked as resolved some time ago, and there are still new ideas and requirements (which is great) coming here? 
Shouldn't they land at a different issue (like bug 286286) or cause this issue to be reopened? Are the last Mik's suggestion reflected anywhere, but this resolved issue?

Just let me know, as I would like understand better how we are suppose to track such stuff on bugzilla here.</thetext>

    <thetext>The recent comments were added as part of a UI review that we held on today's Mylyn call. The usual process is to reopen a bug when additional work needs to be done but in this case we will be tracking that on bug 286286 since the implementations overlap. Please feel free to add your thoughts on bug 286286 if you want to chime in.</thetext>

    <thetext>From Diego at JIRA:

bq. 
Have you generated the new stub classes for Jira 3.13, and compiled your SOAP client with the new classes? As you may know, whenever we deliver a new version of Jira, a new WSDL file may be created. The stub classes that the new WSDL file generates will be different to the previous ones, and as such, your old client will not work against the new version of Jira.

    <thetext>I have not regenerated the stubs, but I am not sure how that would be related to the described problem. David, I haven't been able to reproduce the problem with the  JIRA 3.13 Enterprise standalone. Are you JIRA through proxy or something alike that might have an effect on the http headers?

To verify that if the missing header is caused by Mylyn could you try to fetch this page for your JIRA repository in a browser and take a look at the content encoding returned by the server?

    <thetext>I've posted the request/response to the JIRA support ticket, and I'm waiting for a response.  For your reference this is what I sent to them:

I ran the client through the Axis tcpmon application so that I could see what's going on. Here's the request and response that cause the issue.

    <thetext>You can run the "JIRA WSDL2Java" launch configuration in the jira.core plug-in to regenerate the stubs.

Out of curiosity, could you try to disable compression in the task repository preferences? I know some of the compression related defaults changed in the JIRA server configuration of recent versions.</thetext>

Good hunch.  After disabling compression the problem went away.</thetext>

Yes, I was thinking of that as well (also see bug 216856). As far as I know the gzip filter has been enabled in the web.xml for SOAP requests since JIRA version 3.11.</thetext>

    <thetext>Whilst I'm not an HTTP expert, I did commit the code to atlassian-gzipfilter that causes this bug.

The problem on the server-side is that it is not possible to null out a header once it has been set.  The closest you can get is to 'blank' it out - ie set it to an empty string.

You can see the code responsible to this here:
  http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRA-15658?focusedCommentId=131217#action_131217

From what I can tell of my reading of the HTTP spec - there are no problems with sending empty headers.  However, I'm happy to be proven wrong on this.

The particular code in Axis causing this problem is (from the only online source I could find in my 30 second look):
  http://tinyurl.com/3qtzb2

            Header contentEncoding = 
            	method.getResponseHeader(HTTPConstants.HEADER_CONTENT_ENCODING);
            if (contentEncoding != null) {
            	if (contentEncoding.getValue().
            			equalsIgnoreCase(HTTPConstants.COMPRESSION_GZIP)) {
            		releaseConnectionOnCloseStream = 
            			new GZIPInputStream(releaseConnectionOnCloseStream);
            	} else {
                    AxisFault fault = new AxisFault("HTTP",
                            "unsupported content-encoding of '" 
                    		+ contentEncoding.getValue()
                            + "' found", null, null);
                    throw fault;
            	}
            		
            }


So - really Axis should be doing a '!= ""' as well as a '!= null' on the contentEncoding value before throwing a hissy fit.

I'll do what I can do fix this in JIRA (see if there is a way to delay writing the header until the first byte has been written), but it seems that it should also be fixed in Axis.

This is a pity, because gzip encoding should make a large different to the transport speed of Mylyn &amp; JIRA.  Sorry it hasn't worked in its first implementation.</thetext>

    <thetext>My understanding of http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec2.html is that the content encoding header which is specified as 'Content-Encoding  = "Content-Encoding" ":" 1#content-coding' requires at least a single non-null token which is required to have one or more characters so I believe the returned HTTP header is invalid.

I will add code in Mylyn to work-around the empty http header returned by JIRA to avoid incompatibilities with JIRA 3.11-3.13 that have compression enabled.

What surprises me though is that the SOAP response is not gzip encoded format although the proper headers were sent? It works if I fetch jsp pages.</thetext>

    <thetext>&gt;&gt; Mylyn downloads the entire repository configuration (Projects,
&gt;&gt; Components,
&gt;&gt; Versions, etc.). This can require a significant number of SOAP calls
&gt;&gt; depending on the number of projects in our repository. Which dialog was
&gt;&gt; missing the project indication?
&gt;  
&gt; You mean progress indication ?
&gt;  
&gt; Well there was progress indication, but it just said something like:
&gt;  
&gt; "Repository xyz in progress..." and then a never ending progress bar.
&gt;  
&gt; Maybe have the progress split up in tasks so you can see the actual %
&gt; progress
&gt; and/or update the text to say "Requesting project list..." -&gt; "Requesting
&gt; components from Project X" -&gt; "Requesting versions from Project X" etc.
&gt;  
&gt; Just so it doesn't look frozen</thetext>

If you hit this button in Task Editor whole metadata for the current repository is refreshed. I think we could improve it and refresh only metadata needed to properly render content of the editor/current task.

This would decrease time user has to wait until she can edit the task again.

Also I think it would be more intuitive.

Fix

Here's a fix that extends Mylyn API to allow conector to have a refresh task configuration ability. It doesn't break existing plugins (only adds new methods with a proper defaults).

This patch includes also a fix for 255430 - as they would conflict if tried to apply both of them.

Also include a fix for JIRA that uses the new API which results in refreshing only the selected project attributes after clicking "Refresh Details" in task editor.</thetext>

    <thetext>That looks good Pawel. I have added the necessary API as part of 273469. Can you update your patch to reflect the changes? You will probably need to store the projectId on ITask in JiraRepositoryConnector.updateTaskFromTaskData(). Note that this will currently only work if tasks are updated or new tasks are created. I have created bug 290604 to address that limitation.

Does your patch include the changes for bug 255430? If not, it would be great if you could include them. Instead of using Policy.subMonitorFor() or SubProgressMonitor() I would prefer SubMonitor.convert() which is simpler and more flexible while providing more accurate feedback in most cases.</thetext>

Patch with the new API and SubMonitor

Here's a new patch (includes fix for 273469 too).

Using ITask and updateTaskFromTaskData, attaching new IJiraConstants.ATTRIBUTE_PROJECT_ID to the ITask.

Using SubMonitor to track progress for refresh details job. 

BTW Policy.subMonitorFor is not widely used in Mylyn so Steffen may be it should be depracated? As you said it's better to use SubMonitor.convert.

Looking forward for feedback.

Pawel</thetext>

    <thetext>Looks great. I have tweaked the progress reporting in the attached patch a bit more and reused JiraAttribute.PROJECT.id() instead of adding a new constant IJiraConstants.ATTRIBUTE_PROJECT_ID.

If you add a test case for JiraClientCache.refreshProjectDetails() I'll merge the patch.

&gt; BTW Policy.subMonitorFor is not widely used in Mylyn so Steffen may be it
&gt; should be depracated? As you said it's better to use SubMonitor.convert.

Good idea. I'll do that.</thetext>

Patch with test

Added new JiraClientCacheTest, using a mock here.

Also improved progress indicator a little bit - using SUPPRESS_NONE in additional places makes progress monitor to be more informative.

Cheers,
Pawel</thetext>

    <thetext>(In reply to comment #8)
&gt; BTW has anyone configured JIRA 4.0 test instance? I see most of the tests are
&gt; failing for it?

Afaik we can only run one instance at a time (due to server resources), so the 4.0.0 instance is not running. Some tests might pass because they do not need the server.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks Pawel! I have applied the patch.

We'll look into setting up a public JIRA 4.0 server for testing again as part of bug 290202 but as Thomas has mentioned our Eclipse vserver may not have sufficient resources to run multiple instances of JIRA. If that turns out to be the case I'll add a magic flag to enable JIRA 4.0 tests so they won't run by default and cause the suite to fail.</thetext>

    <thetext>+1.  Might not make 2.0 though.

Can we do something easy and manual for now, e.g. adding a "Refresh Attributes from server" button to the Attributes section, right on the section title?  That's nice because it's in-line with where you are looking when you notice an attribute missing.</thetext>

    <thetext>That won't help since the error is displayed when synchronizing changes and not when the editor is opened. 

The error message should at least give the user a hint to fix the problem.</thetext>

patch

This is my proposal for a fix.
A testcase might come up, I am trying to programmatically create (and delete) a project, not sure if and how that will work. Just thought I post this so you can have a look at it Steffen (if you have time :) )</thetext>

patch

This patch only updates the configuration once per query.
I do realize now this fix only fixes the issues while doing a synchronize and for missing projects, but not for the other causes (like retrieving an issue by key).</thetext>

    <thetext>That's a good first pass Thomas. The only problem is that if a query matches multiple issues that are missing a property in the configuration, the change would only work for the first issue that matches. Instead of doing the configuration update in the connector we should move the logic to JiraClient. Before we can resolve this bug I think we need to fix bug 277254 and bug 273469 first. Unfortunately we are out of time for the current release cycle. We'll pick this up again for the next milestone.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks Pawel. I have applied the patch and added additional fixes for breakage in the query construction. It would be great if you could take a look at my changes in JiraFilterDefinitionConverter and JiraClientCache. I'll mark this bug as resolved but we still need test cases for each of the unresolved subtasks.</thetext>

    <thetext>I think this basically boils down to setting a flag on the project to track whether configuration has been downloaded for that project or not. 

All methods that require configuration should be changed to scope configuration updates to the required project instead of getting all details, e.g. JiraTaskDataHandler.initializeTaskData(). In addition the query page and new task page need to have a way to limit configuration refresh to fetching the list of projects (and other global attributes).</thetext>

Jira Filter Definition Page rework

So, this is a first step to implement this story.

Added details flag to Project. Reworked JFDP - if you click on a project it will download details. 

Also fixed some inconsistiency with JIRA - if you select multiple projects you should not be able to select fix for, component or affects. Also issue types in this case are taken from global settings.

JiraClientCache.initializeIssueTypes downloads only global issue types. As we don't have projects available it's not possible to get all issue types here.

Tomorrow I'll work on lazy project updates in RSS reader.</thetext>

Version 3

Fixed collisions, added issueTypesById to project, handling case when user wants to create a task for project that doesn't have details downloaded (added icon and message in wizard). Also JiraRSSHandler will update project if version, fix version or component were not found in case. Tomorrow I'll work on issue types, and others.

Steffen please do a code review for this. It'd be great to hear is it the right direction. It's easier to fix the course now than later.

Cheers,
Pawel</thetext>

    <thetext>The changes look great! It's a big improvement in terms of user experience. 

 A couple of thoughts:
* Can you leave out the changes to JiraRssHandler for now? I would like to track that on bug 189689. 
* The changes to NewJiraTaskWizard.getInitializationData() don't seem necessary. Shouldn't JiraTaskDataHandler.initializeTaskData() take care of updating the configuration? Doing something like this:
		if (!project.hasDetails()) {
			try {
				client.getCache().refreshProjectDetails(project.getId(), monitor);
			} catch (JiraException ex) {
				IStatus status = JiraCorePlugin.toStatus(repository, ex);
				trace(status);
				throw new CoreException(status);
			}
		}
* The icon decoration in the new task wizard looks cool but it's not obvious what it means. I think we should leave it out and just go with the message in the wizard header for now.
* Can you move the loop in JiraFilterDefinitionPage.updateCurrentProjects() inside the job so that there is only continuous progress report?</thetext>

Version 4

Changed on Steffen's suggestion. Using different icon (if you don't like it, just remove it). Moved JiraRssHandler changes out to 189689.</thetext>

    <thetext>Excellent! I have committed the patch and made the following changes:

New task wizard:
* Used a selection listener instead of post selection listener to provide instant feedback
* Set a title on the wizard page
* Commented out icons for now to discuss this on a UI review

Query page:
* Increased width of date pickers (bug 286286)
* Unified refresh of project list and project details in single operation

Shawn suggested to add a check box to filter projects in the new task wizard to only show the ones that have details. This could be particularly helpful for repositories with many projects where the user is only interested in a subset of the projects. I have put this up for a UI review during the next Mylyn meeting.</thetext>

    <thetext>h3. UI review from the latest screenshot

* Icons are confusing because in the common scenario the user can happily interact with projects that don't have a cached configuration.
* Shawn's suggestion makes sense, since it address the offline use case, and is helpful in the connected use case for showing the subset of projects.
* Suggest making a sticky checkbox called "Only show projects active in Task List" to maintain our story of transparent offline use, and indicate that the projects shown are the ones with tasks in the Task List.  
* Remove this filter if user has filter text.
* "Update Projects from Repository" -&gt; "Update Project Listing"</thetext>

    <thetext>The JiraConnectorUI Test, when run separately (as plug-in test) will fail since while the client retrieved in the test itself updates its client data object, a background operations seems to set a different clientData object to the clientManager. So while the client of the test still has the updated clientData, retrieving a client from the factory actually gets a client with the (non updated) clientData from the clientManager, thus making the test fail.

Not sure if and when this problem might surface in real usage (it should only show as clientData not being there and thus requiring retrieval, so worst case another round of repository configuration update (which can be very expensive).

Steffen, please add/correct if I did not grasp this right :)</thetext>

    <thetext>Proposed design:
- Share a single JiraClient object for all connections
- Only discard the client if the repository URL changes
- Need to ensure that TaskRepository setting changes, e.g. proxy configuration, are propagated to the client

    <thetext>I have taken a first pass at this. I still need to add tests and handle the case when credentials change. This will require flushing sessions.

As part of this I have refactored some of the JIRA tests to use JiraFixture to support running tests against multiple versions of JIRA (bug 290203).</thetext>

    <thetext>Steffen, not totally sure that this is related, but my "all mine" query against all StAc projects now seems to give me all unassigned issues back. So it seems that there was no login, and thus the query assumes no user?

    <thetext>Did some further testing: I could not reproduce it in a test workspace, but it kept on happening in my normal workspace. I tried to reenter the credentials, did not help. Changing the query to "specific user" and me gave me the expected results, chaning it back to current again all unassigned tasks.
Restarting my workspace did the trick, now the query is fine again.

I did screw around with the secure storage this morning, but since we don't store the credentials there, it shouldnt matter. So not sure what actually cause that, maybe it makes sense to you (if it is related to the JiraClient work done)...</thetext>

That sounds like an expired login session. Can you check if that also happens right after startup or if the query starts returning the wrong results after a certain timeout?</thetext>

    <thetext>Hm, I rebootstrapped this morning, there was a sync going on for sure, without any of those problems. Then I came to work, and at the sync there I had the problems.

    <thetext>The authentication is cookie based so a different (outgoing) IP or a timeout may trigger it to expire. I suspect that it's a side effect of the fix for bug 277405 which is now surfacing again. I think we'll need to validate the login state for each request to ensure that it is still valid.</thetext>

Updating cache on demand

Hi Steffen here's a patch that enables cache refresh. If RSS handler notices any unknown issue type, priority, status or resolution it will trigger cache refresh. This will fix the problem described it this bug. Also added a test case that check if cache was populated correctly in this scenario.

Cheers,
Pawel</thetext>

Version 2

Here's a patch with better tests for JiraRssHandler. Also I fixed one of the tests that were failing after recent changes, JiraTestUtil.newSubTask failed with NPE. Other small fixes related to recent changes.

This patch is longer than 250 lines as I attach XML query result needed for my mock.</thetext>

    <thetext>I tried to create a new Task in my JIRA repository with Mylyn + JIRA connector. First I got a  message "could not create ticket". I couldn't find anything on the internet about this error message, so I tried to change the JIRA connector configuration, enabling HTTP authentication - just for a try. But then I got this null pointer exception.

    <thetext>The error above is most likely caused by missing attributes which was fixed recently. As a work-around please  select "Update attributes" from the context menu of the repository in the repositories view. 

Could you try the latest dev build available here and report back if issue creation still fails?

OK, I have performed the "update attributes" and I didn't get any stack trace this time. But, I still get the "Could not create ticket" message. I guess that's because we have custom (mandatory) attributes in our JIRA. I read something about that on the Eclipsepedia  http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn_Jira_Connector

    <thetext>Thomas, could you give an example of a custom attribute that needs to be specified during issue creation? Are those attributes displayed in the Mylyn task editor?</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks Thomas. It seems that Mylyn parses information about custom fields from the RSS which does not work for creating new issues. The JiraSoapService offers a getCustomFields() method that should be in that case. I'll investigate that for the next release if time permits.</thetext>

    <thetext>Steffen, getCustomFields() call offers much less information about custom fields that is available in RSS. Basically it only give field ids. We either have to cache information about fields collected from issues or rpc api need to be extended to provide complete information about field names, types and available options. The latter also not available in the rss feed. See current limitations section for jira connector on the wiki.</thetext>

patch attached.

How it works:

* It displays 'Viewable By" combo box below the new comment window in exactly the same way as JIRA does.
* The combo contains only roles (there is no way to retrieve groups from JIRA).
* The combo contains all roles (there is no way to filter the list by project and user - available soap call requires administrative privileges). When user tries to add comment visible to the role he is not a member then Mylyn displays standard error in the editor.</thetext>

    <thetext>(In reply to comment #18)
&gt; The UI patch has not been applied yet so this feature is still not visible. We
&gt; should resume work on that feature soon so stay tuned.

It's now more than a year later, and I still don't see this in the (latest) Mylyn UI.  Did this become the domain of the Atlassian PLE connector?  In any case RESOLVED FIXED is a bit misleading.

See also my comments on 212960 and the issue I've added on the Atlassian side (https://studio.atlassian.com/browse/PLE-1301)

Thanks,

    <thetext>It has been fixed and the change was visible in the UI. Unfortunately the Project Owner decided to remove the feature as it was only partially implemented due to the JIRA API limitations. Please see my comment at https://studio.atlassian.com/browse/PLE-1301.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks Thomas. I have applied the patch with a few modifications: I have removed the global list of security levels from JiraClientData and added a level for "None". I have also fixed setting the security level when creating new tasks and added a test case.</thetext>

    <thetext>Steffen,

While this has been resolved for quite a while, I still don't see the 'Security Level' field available when working against JIRA repository issues in Mylyn.  Am I just missing something?

I've added this story under the Atlassian PLE project, but perhaps you can comment as well.

    <thetext>The Mylyn JIRA Connector has moved to Atlassian and is now maintained outside of the Mylyn project. I have casted a vote for the linked issue but I am afraid that is all I can do as I am no longer involved in supporting the connector

    <thetext>Due to recent changes in the build system (bug 355963) plug-ins and features may no longer have the same id. Unfortunately the HtmlText component uses the same ID org.eclipse.mylyn.htmltext for it's bundle and feature. To resolve the conflict we need to either rename the feature or plug-in id.

The standard Mylyn convention is to append ui, core, tests etc. to plug-in ids, e.g.:

 Feature: org.eclipse.mylyn.htmltext
 Plug-in: org.eclipse.mylyn.htmltext.ui
 
The alternative is to change the feature ID to org.eclipse.mylyn.htmltext.feature. Changing the feature ID would cause problems for users who have the feature already installed. These users would need to uninstall the old feature and re-install the new feature.</thetext>

&gt; I'm in favor of changing the plug-in id since that affect integrators rather
&gt; than users.

I agree. Adding a .ui to the bundles id would be the easiest. In addition to the changes in the bundles MANIFEST.MF the Id must be also changed org.eclipse.mylyn.htmltext.HtmlTextActivator.PLUGIN_ID</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks for the quick feedback. I have renamed the bundle and folder to org.eclipse.mylyn.htmltext.ui. Everyone who has imported the project into a workspace will need to re-import it under the new name.

    <thetext>Don't we introduce similar problems for the end-user when we change the plug-in id?

As far as I see it p2 will not match these two plug-ins anymore and install the new one on top of the old one, won't it?

If really no other problems occur still the ui parts will appear twice.</thetext>

&gt; Don't we introduce similar problems for the end-user when we change the plug-in
&gt; id?

In this case there shouldn't be any conflicts when both bundles are installed.
 
&gt; As far as I see it p2 will not match these two plug-ins anymore and install the
&gt; new one on top of the old one, won't it?

My understanding is that p2 will remove plug-ins that are no longer referenced if the corresponding feature is uninstalled.
 
&gt; If really no other problems occur still the ui parts will appear twice.

True, but in this case we are lucky since the plug-ins does not contribute any UI extensions.</thetext>

    <thetext>To lower maintenance and testing overhead I propose that we stop support for unmaintained repository versions. This would leave support for these versions:

* Bugzilla 3.4.12, 3.6.6, 4.0.2
* Trac 0.11.7, 0.12.2
* Hudson 2.1.0
* Jenkins 1.427
* Gerrit 2.2.1

Active testing of the following version would be discontinued:

* Bugzilla 3.0, 3.2
* Trac 0.10
* Hudson/Jenkins 1.367
* Gerrit 2.1.5</thetext>

    <thetext>I am experiencing a problem which seems to be coming from the recent re-factorings i.e. Bug 360301, Bug 350385 and Bug 305782

  After installing latest Mylyn Reiews, the Eclipse installation is not starting and is complaining of a class not found exception, so the TasksUIPlugin can not be started.

Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/eclipse/mylyn/internal/tasks/core/notifications/Environment
	at java.lang.Class.getDeclaredConstructors0(Native Method)
	at java.lang.Class.privateGetDeclaredConstructors(Class.java:2389)
	at java.lang.Class.getConstructor0(Class.java:2699)
	at java.lang.Class.newInstance0(Class.java:326)
	at java.lang.Class.newInstance(Class.java:308)
	at org.eclipse.osgi.framework.internal.core.AbstractBundle.loadBundleActivator(AbstractBundle.java:166)
	... 69 more     

Looking at the latest changes in Tasks core, it can be seen that the class above was removed from o.e.m.tasks.core 
  However the upgraded installation picked up the new tasks.core plug-in but not the latest o.e.m.tasks.ui plug-in.

Looking at the o.e.mylyn.taks.ui manifest, it specifies dependencies to o.e.m.tasks.core [3.0.0, 4.0.0).  

I think the minimum dependency should now be moved to 3.7
so the latest tasks.ui gets loaded as well.

A separate task shall also be raised to make sure Mylyn Versions and Mylyn Reviews introduce dependencies at the feature level to make the propagation of dependencies more robust.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks for pointing that out. I have changed the version constraints in all framework bundles to require version 0.9.0 or 3.7.0 or higher of other Mylyn bundles.

I am not sure why you encountered this error. It seems that the updated notifications bundle did get installed but since there are several versions of some bundles Eclipse may have loaded the wrong combination of versions. The changes I made and restructured Mylyn commons features should avoid this scenario in the future.</thetext>

    <thetext>To lower maintenance and testing overhead I propose that we stop support for unmaintained repository versions. This would leave support for these versions:

* Bugzilla 3.6, 4.0, 4.2
* Trac 0.12
* Hudson 2.2, 3.0
* Jenkins 1.447
* Gerrit 2.3

Active testing of the following version would be discontinued:

* Bugzilla 3.4
* Trac 0.11
* Hudson 2.1
* Jenkins 1.424
* Gerrit 2.1, 2.2</thetext>

    <thetext>From bug 386344 comment 15:

I modified a few things in the last patch set:
* The mysql root password is not changed. This would interfere with other puppet scripts running on the same VM.
* All perl modules are consumed as system packages to avoid long perl compile processes.
* XML-RPC is disabled by modifying the script rather than relying on a perl module not being present.
* The Vagrant port is changes to be consistent with other Mylyn configurations.

Frank, I would prefer if the Bugzilla Apache configurations were located under /home/tools/bugzilla rather than in the global configuration and included in the same way as the Trac sites.</thetext>

    <bug_when>2012-11-06 05:14:54 -0500</bug_when>
    <thetext>I rebased the change and updated the commit message to reference this task so we can track the globabl configuration on the parent task. Frank, in order to move things forward I'm okay with submitting the current state and making refinements in subsequent commits.

&gt; Frank, there were a bunch of test failures in the last build. Not sure if
&gt; these are related to the test changes or if something went wrong on Hudson:

    <thetext>No, let's look into the cause of the failure.  I'm suspecting that DownloadAttachmentJob runs into an exception and hence deletes the file (see exceptionThrown flag). We should change the test to use AttachmentUtil.downloadAttachment() instead of DownloadAttachmentJob so we can detect the exception.</thetext>

Can you check what connections are in the poll when the test failure occurs? We need to figure out if there is something in the Bugzilla connector that is leaking connections.

    <thetext>I added an initial version for a vagrant/puppet configuration to provision a VM with several versions of Hudson and Jenkins. To run it simply execute vagrant.sh in org.eclipse.mylyn.releng/vagrant. The web server in the VM is mapped to port 8080. Hudson 2.2 is accessible from http://localhost:8080/hudson-2.2 for instance once the VM is up.</thetext>

    <thetext>I added a module for trac that automatically provisions 9 trac instances with different versions and authentication methods.

Frank, we'll need to do something similar for Bugzilla. If you are interested you can try it by running "vagrant up" in the org.eclipse.mylyn/org.eclipse.mylyn.releng/vagrant directory. You'll need to have vagrant installed (http://vagrantup.com/).

Once the VM is provisioned and running you can access the trac instances at http://localhost:2080/trac-0.12.

To access the shell on the VM use "vagrant ssh" and to shutdown the VM just run "vagrant halt". You can get rid of the VM by running "vagrant destroy".</thetext>

    <thetext>New Patch Set 3 is now in the review.

I did some changes so that trac  now run without the start.sh script.
the bugzilla VM includes  phpmyadmin so you can use localhost:3081/phpmyadmin for brows the mysql databases

with the following an an replacement of /org.eclipse.mylyn.releng/vagrant/Vagrantfile
Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
	config.vm.define :trac do |trac_config|
		trac_config.vm.box = "lucid32"
		trac_config.vm.box_url = "http://files.vagrantup.com/lucid32.box"

		trac_config.vm.provision :puppet do |puppet|

			puppet.manifests_path = "../../../org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks/org.eclipse.mylyn.trac.releng/modules/trac/manifests"
			puppet.manifest_file = "trac.pp"
		end
		trac_config.vm.provision :shell, :path =&gt; "../../../org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks/org.eclipse.mylyn.trac.releng/scripts/start.sh"
		trac_config.vm.forward_port 80, 3080
		trac_config.vm.forward_port 443, 3443
	end

	config.vm.define :bugzilla do |bugzilla_config|
		bugzilla_config.vm.box = "lucid32"

		end
		bugzilla_config.vm.forward_port 80, 3081
		bugzilla_config.vm.forward_port 443, 3444

end

you can start trac and bugzilla with vagrant up</thetext>

* All perl modules are consumed as system packages to avoid long perl compile processes.
* XML-RPC is disabled by modifying the script rather than relying on a perl module not being present.
* The Vagrant port is changes to be consistent with other Mylyn configurations.

Frank, I would prefer if the Bugzilla Apache configurations were located under /home/tools/bugzilla rather than in the global configuration and included in the same way as the Trac sites.</thetext>

    <thetext>Puppet based provisioning now works for all supported repository types: Bugzilla, Gerrit, Hudson, Jenkins, Trac.  It's as easy as typing "vagrant up" to provision the a full local Mylyn test environment in a VM.

The test repositories on mylyn.org are provisioned using the same puppet based infrastructure. Repositories are currently updated manually when the puppet configuration changes but work is underway to fully automate the process (bug 394052).</thetext>

    <thetext>Currently offline task data is serialized to disk in a single file. This mechanism can easily break with changes to the participating classes and is slow when the cache file is large. Alternate methods need to be considered such as using xml and multiple files.</thetext>

    <thetext>Regarding removing repository configuration data from offline task data....what if we kept the old Repository configuration data? If both were being cached in the .mylar folder along with all the other data then we'd have this available to us (assuming it didn't get deleted along with repository deletion). Currently if you try to open a task who's repository has been deleted nothing happens (created bug#161297).  </thetext>

    <thetext>That sounds like a good idea.  So the then the .mylar folder gets two new kinds of files, one for offline data, one for repository config?  Perhaps we should make a folder per-repository so that the structure looks something like this?
- .mylar/
    - repositories.xml.zip
    - repositories-data/
      - https%3A%2F%2Fbugs.eclipse.org-config.xml.zip
      - https%3A%2F%2Fbugs.eclipse.org-offline.data

    <thetext>As a first pass I can export task data as XML (via IMemento) to produce an -offline.data file which holds task data AND repository configuration options (as it is now serialized).  Then once we've determined how to externalize configuration data in a generic way (bug#150680) we can pull that data out into its own -config.xml.zip file (which will greatly simplify the task data xml).  Or do we try to do the complete separation all in one shot?</thetext>

    <thetext>That does sound like a good baby step.  The cost is that if we do two releases that both change formats people lose their offline stuff twice.  So I think this is better to do this in one go.  If it's too involved to get finished by early tomorrow I suggest you postpone to 0.9.</thetext>

    <thetext>Regardless of using Lucene it maybe a good idea to break task data into multiple chunks (i.e. per category/query). With Lucene you can search trough them trough MultiReader and still able to update individual indexes.

Another question is do we want to keep feature for allowing tasks in the root of the task list or create some placeholder by default (i.e. "Default", "Local" or "My Tasks" category).</thetext>

    <thetext>We should discuss what to store in the attributes at some point. I noticed that some of the Trac attributes such as status are currently displayed twice in the editor. These are now flagged as "hidden" to not display them in the attributes section but this only takes effect when the task is actually synchronized. 

I think these UI specific attributes should not be serialized but retrieved from the factory. This is related to bug 150680.</thetext>

    <thetext>Yes, one of the major goals of this refactoring will be extraction of the ui related details from the task data such as visibility, operations and their descriptions etc... The attribute factory does seem like the right place for most of this.</thetext>

    <thetext>Here are the requirements that we outlined on today's call.
* Robustness to format change (e.g. can add attributes without breaking)
* Incremental read/write (e.g. separate files)
* In-memory cache, lazy access to non-cached data (e.g. 20MB max)
* Connectors only have to provide at most 2 mappings (repo -&gt; RepositoryTaskData -&gt; repo update)
* Figure out whether format should encode data types, not just Strings (probably not)
* External attributes should remain separate (i.e. attachments, could improve lifecycle)</thetext>

naive performance test

Here is a naive performance test comparing performance of db4o 6.1, Lucene 2.1 and Oracle Berkley for Java 3.2.23

It is adding/updating 1000 simple records and then run query by "group" field. Probably there is something wrong with the way I implemented code for db4o, but in my test it is about 10x slover then Lucene. There results are here:

bdb add/update: 0.97 sec
bdb query: need to implement searching by group field

lucene add/update: 2.63 sec
lucene query: 0.03 sec

db4o add/update: 20.72 sec
db4o query: 0.125 sec</thetext>

The scores for db4o look indeed weird. Maybe Ismael could comment as well. The first thing I tried was adding an index to the fields in Simple. This improved the add/update speed from 7 seconds to 1 second on my machine. Usually you would add all your object's ids to the index:

private static final class Simple implements Serializable {
  @Indexed
  String group;

  @Indexed
  String foo;

  @Indexed
  int n;

  public Simple(String group, String foo, int n) {
    this.group = group;
    this.foo = foo;
    this.n = n;
  }
}</thetext>

    <thetext>Btw to be fair, I think you should configure Lucene to flush changes to the disk immediately. If the application crashes, the buffered documents in Lucene will be lost. I think by default, Lucene buffers up to 10 documents before flushing them.</thetext>

I changed it to use S.O.D.A queries, indexed the two fields that are used in the queries, set Db4o.configure().flushFileBuffers(false) and changed the query during the add/update to match the lucene one (just a single field) and I get the following:

db4o: 0.32
db4o: 0.045

Offline refactoring take 1

This patch includes two major changes:

1) Relocates the .mylar data folder to .metadat/.mylyn 
2) Includes new offline storage which writes all task data to zipped xml files within a folder named for the repository. The data is held in .metadata/.mylyn/storage. There are still plenty of improvements to be made including removal of the AttributeFactory but this will need to be done at a later date.</thetext>

&gt; * There are potential race conditions in OfflineCachingStorage, consider
&gt; synchronizing all methods
Yup, done.
&gt; * What happens if a repository URL is changed? Is the task data deleted or
&gt; migrated?
Data is currently manually migrated by TaskListManager. We could consider adding this functionality directly to the storage though.</thetext>

callback class

The patch adds a new class AbstractWebLocation which has methods for retrieving credentials and proxy information. The idea is to use this class instead of passing thw data as individual arguments. I will post a second patch later that demonstrates how to use the new API to prompt the user for credentials.</thetext>

web location classes for TaskRepository

This patch contains the tasks API for the new WebLocation class. It provides two factories for creating web locations for TaskRepository objects: one for core and one for UI. The split is necessary since locations need to be available to core but also need to hook into the UI to prompt the user for passwords and such. Basically connectors will start out with a TaskRepositoryLocationFactory and when the connector ui starts up it will replace that factory in the connector core with a TaskRepositoryLocationFactoryUi. I will attach a patch to bug 207531 that demonstrates how the API will be used for the Trac connector.</thetext>

patch

The patch adds support in TaskRepository to store passwords without saving to the key ring. It also adds checkboxes to the repository settings page to select if passwords should be saved.

The implementation adds a generic method to TaskRepository that allows to set and retrieve credentials for different types of authentication (repository (default), http, proxy). The authentication type is a string. I have cleaned up some of the code duplication in that class but it should be reviewed for 3.0.

Rob, please review and apply.

The repository settings page is currently lacking a warning that storing passwords is potentially dangerous. This could be displayed in the dialog header when Save Password is selected to avoid cluttering the UI further.</thetext>

    <thetext>Isn't 3 separate settings for saving passwords is too much or I am missing something? I think it complicates UI even more then per-repository timeouts that been considered too complicated (and in my humble opinion timeouts are more critical then this).</thetext>

    <thetext>I agree that having three check boxes is not optimal. The reason I added all three is that there is scenario where a I have less valuable passwords for proxies or http authentication than for the repository. I would want to save those but enter the one for the repository once per session. 

At some point the check boxes could be replaced by a separate UI in the preferences for managing passwords. I suggest to go with the current solution and improve when have more resources.</thetext>

    <thetext>The TaskRepository refactoring and unit tests look great.  Patch applied.  Lets iterate on the repository settings page ui.  I agree with Eugene's observation regarding number of save password options. We should also consider switching the presentation order to:   Save Password [X]   (we may still have space for a short warning label right after that as well).</thetext>

    <thetext>Few more random comments on the changes:

- @deprecated should have some description what to use instead
- values for standard properties (including should "save password") should came from single place in IRepositoryConstants and not from constants in TaskRepository class
- Why the following method are public api? I don't see them used anywhere outside TaskRepository
  getUserName(String authType) 
  getPassword(String authType) 
  setCredentials(String authType, String username, String password)

    <thetext> (In reply to comment #7)
&gt; - @deprecated should have some description what to use instead

IMHO, the deprecated fields shouldn't have been API in the first place. The alternative is to not use them.

&gt; - values for standard properties (including should "save password") should came
&gt; from single place in IRepositoryConstants and not from constants in
&gt; TaskRepository class

Sounds like a good idea. Please file a bug report for that.

&gt; getUserName(String authType)
&gt; getPassword(String authType)

The patch is part of a larger set of patches that I split up to ease the review process. Please see the sibling bugs and parent bug of this report for details.</thetext>

So, that is what you should put into the deprecation text

I am really surprised with such response. My comments are related to the api changes in a scope of the currently *open* bug.

I don't know about other patches, but for example there are 3 shortcuts to the getUserName() method. Are you planning to expose non standard authTypes or what?</thetext>

&gt; changes in a scope of the currently *open* bug.

Sorry, I didn't realize IRepositoryConstants exists already. I thought you were suggesting a larger refactoring to extract all default values from TaskRepository. Currently the only default value defined in IRepositoryConstants seems to be the kind whereas other defaults such as time zone or charset are defined in TaskRepository which is the example I followed in the patch. 

&gt; &gt; &gt; - Why the following method are public api? I don't see them used anywhere
&gt; &gt; &gt; outside TaskRepository
&gt; &gt; &gt; getUserName(String authType)
&gt; &gt; &gt; getPassword(String authType)
&gt; &gt; &gt; setCredentials(String authType, String username, String password)
&gt; &gt; The patch is part of a larger set of patches that I split up to ease the
&gt; review
&gt; &gt; process. Please see the sibling bugs and parent bug of this report for
&gt; details.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't know about other patches, but for example there are 3 shortcuts to the
&gt; getUserName() method. Are you planning to expose non standard authTypes or what?

Not sure what you mean. I want to avoid code duplication that is why I added these methods. I would like to remove other methods to retrieve credentials for 3.0.

-1. It is basically issue about arbitrary attributes vs. strongly typed access. While I am usually in a favor of arbitrary attributes, in this case I prefer strongly typed methods, because this stuff is stored into the keyring and it is better to control what user can store in there.</thetext>

Exactly. It should be exposing Enum and not String-based prefixes, or leave the current methods alone. I'd suggest to keep the current methods, because this change don't bring anything besides pure aestetic, but it will affect integrators.</thetext>

The reason I did not choose an enum type is that it can not be extended by integrators and it will keep us from adding new authentication types (e.g. for socks proxies) without breaking backwards compatibility. 

The API is used by TaskRepositoryLocationUi for storing and retrieving credentials using the string prefix which is provided by the caller (connector). If we know for certain that no additional authentication types will be added in the future and that connectors will never require more than the three provided types DEFAULT, HTTP and PROXY I'll consider making the authentication type an enum. </thetext>

Is there a use case or driver for extending that? socks proxy is a bad example because I don't think that someone would have both socks and http proxy, so that setting is meant to be saved under proxy password for any proxy type.

The current API is inconsistent, duplicates code, difficult to extend, has race conditions and not easy to test. My patches reduces the number of methods on TaskRepository significantly, keeps the functionality and addresses the issues mentioned in the previous sentence.

&gt; &gt; The current API is inconsistent, duplicates code, difficult to extend,
&gt;

The API was extended to set a flag wether the password should be stored.

&gt; However I do see that your changes are
&gt; about to break support for non-web connectors (including mail and rmi-based
&gt; connectors) and I think that web credentials should not be part of the

Credential handling is part of the TaskRepository API. The naming is not perfect but consistent with other classes in the web core plugin. Sharing the credentials classes between the web core plug-in and tasks framework 

&gt; &gt; has race conditions and not easy to test
&gt; 
&gt; would you please elaborate about the race conditions? 

Credentials can not be retrieved as a consistent pair due to getUserName() and getPassword() being two separate methods.

&gt; also I don't see how
&gt; changing methods that store stuff into the same place is easier to test. can you
&gt; please explain?

Instead of duplicating test cases three times for exactly the same logic (storing a username/password) pair the test logic can now be implemented once.

&gt; strangely it feels like number of methods just doubled and I still don't see how
&gt; racing conditions are addressed

I haven't addressed all race conditions in TaskRepository, yet, but that should be done at some point. I added a comment to the methods that I plan to deprecate and then remove.

It shouldn't be, because it is specific only to http stuff. So, I'd say turn it other way around - create factory the would make credential instance from the TaskRepository, but don't couple those two together.

&gt; Instead of duplicating test cases three times for exactly the same logic

Can't you just write a selector method in your test case that will encapsulate logic for calling the right metods?

&gt; Eugene, what is the point of this discussion?

I still don't getting the point in these api changes. A smaller api stuff been kicked out in a past... 
Also I do believe that getUserName() is less obscure then getAuthSomething(someEnumType), besides, it is a valid use case to allow to set user an password independent from each other (i.e. set the user name in repo settings and only enter password upon connect).</thetext>

That sounds like a more generic approach that could be worth investigating. So far I have not seen a need for more than username/password credentials but there could certainly be other use-cases. Please file a bug report and provide more details about the proposed API so we can consider this for 3.0.

use enum for authentication type

The patch uses an enum to determine the authentication type. My assumption that additional enum constants can not be added without breaking binary compatibility was not correct. This can be extended on the framework level in the future but now restricts integrators to the pre-defined authentication types.</thetext>

I understand your frustration with bug 199818, but we have dedicated a large amount of discussion time to figuring that out and its simply not a straightforward change.  I think this one was quite straightforward even though it turned out involved.  Frankly I'm not sure if this feature was important enough but we took it seriously because it is security related.  If there are other places where there were straightforward API changes that should have been applied before this one please email me with them so that I can review our prioritization process.</thetext>

Implementing new API early and deprecating old API will give integrators more time to migrate.

    <thetext>Guys, why no one responded to my concerns about coupling TaskRepository class with web-specific stuff? Namely the WebCredentials class, which is imply something related to "web". I haven't looked at the code in deep details, and at least this credential class is purely named (should have no "web" in it).

Also, while you are on those changes, and actually changing the public api, it would make sense to not stop half way and make auth extendable, for example, take into the account use cases when authorization not need any user name/password, but require a private key to be specified.</thetext>

    <thetext>I chose the name WebCredentials to avoid a name clash with the Credentials class that is part of HttpClient and often used in the same classes. Are there any other suggestions for naming that class?

Supporting certificate authentication has certainly come up as a use-case. It is out of scope of this bug report to provide an extensive authentication API and not a priority for 2.2. Still I want to make sure that the changes made to the authentication API are stable and enable extendability for future releases.  Eugene, it would be very helpful if you opened a new bug report and listed your requirements so we can ensure that the current API meet those requirements before it is frozen for 2.2.

    <thetext>From bug 169426 comment 25:

For cloning of task data a new method should be added to AbstractTaskDataHandler. A default implementation could clone the common attributes: summary, description and possibly iterate over editable attributes of the source task data and the new task data. The latter is probably only feasible if both task data objects are associated with the same repository. Connectors can overwrite that method and provide a more specific implementation if needed.</thetext>

    <thetext> (In reply to comment #1)
&gt; Created an attachment (id=82625)
&gt; implementation of cloneTaskData

I think AbstractTaskDataHandler.cloneTaskData should be called from performFinish of the New&lt;RepositoryTyp&gt;TaskWizard (NewBugzillaTaskWizard, NewJiraTaskWizard, ...).

How we can get the information from the action to the New&lt;RepositoryTyp&gt;TaskWizard.

What do you think about this.

- Create of a class that can hold the information of the sourceTaskData. This can be used for other cases like comments, stacktrace, ...
- this class should be passed to the wizard so that we can pass it  to connectorUi.getNewTaskWizard and then to New&lt;RepositoryTyp&gt;TaskWizard

But this meens that AbstractRepositoryConnectorUi must be changed. This meen that all Connectors need to be modified.

What is the best way to do this.

&gt; that all Connectors need to be modified.
&gt; 

Should we define an Interface which we can add to the subclasses of AbstractRepositoryConnectorUi.
Then  in NewTaskPage we can test if the new method is defined and use it so that we can reate the correct version of New&lt;RepositoryType&gt;TaskWizard

Should I try this way?</thetext>

test implementation

This is a test of the new way.

I create CloneTaskAction as an example to demo that this works.

Do you think this is the right way?

If so we can extend NewTaskWizardSeletion to handel the other cases.</thetext>

    <thetext>The patch is looking good so far. Let's focus on adding the new API to TaskDataHandler first before implementing the wizard. Most important are JUnit test cases that verify the implementation of the clone method using task data objects (see http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn_Contributor_Reference#Writing_Tests). I think the signature of the clone method should look like this:

 public void cloneTaskData(RepositoryTaskData sourceTaskData, RepositoryTaskData targetTaskData);
 
A list of attributes to ignore would be connector specific and difficult to specifiy for a caller. How about making the default implemenation only clone attributes that exist on the source as well as on the target task data? In case connectors need to ignore certain attributes the default implementation should be overriden in the connector.

It would be great if you could attach a patch that contains the changes to AbstractTaskDataHandler and test cases only. Once that is merged we can iterate further on implementing the wizard. Here are a few remarks from looking through the patch:

- Please delete all comments before attaching a patch to ease the reviewing process. If there are open questions about the implementation it is better to discuss on the bug before attaching a patch.

- I like idea of having the NewTaskWizardSeletion class that encapsulates the task selection. You could rename it to TaskSelection and it should be immutable.
 
- The default implementation of  the new getNewTaskWizard() method in AbstractRepositoryConnectorUi should invoke the old method ignoring the selection and getNewTaskWizardType() is not needed. That way NewTaskWizard can always invoke the new method and the old method can be marked as deprecated and removed in the 3.0 release.

- The TaskSelection object could only be passed to NewTaskWizard and NewTaskPage for now instead of modifying SelectRepositoryPage which is used in many other places as well that don't require the selection.

    <thetext>What is the relation to bug 161646: [patch] Support for Clone this bug
There you can cascade a bug to another (kind of) repository with a back reference.
The copying of data can be more elaborate, is that done here?

    <thetext>I was wondering if it would make sense that the attributes that can't be mapped are appended to the description?  I think that this is useful since it is easier to delete a chunk of text over trying to merge some information from the old task to the new one.</thetext>

    <thetext>Shawn, that sounds like a great idea. There is some pending work for having a textual representation of differences between task data on bug 205861. We should be able to reuse some of that code once we are done here.</thetext>

    <thetext>I have committed the patch with modifications. The default implementation clones all attributes if the source and target task data task and repository kinds match. In other cases it will only clone a selected set of attributes that have keys defined in RepositoryTaskAttribute.

Rob, please review the Bugzilla specific test case. I haven't applied it, yet.</thetext>

    <thetext>I need to go to the browser view to do a 'clone this bug' command.

I use this command in the situation where I have one application deployed on different sites.
Each site is a bugzilla product, so once I determine that a bug has occurences on different sites, I want to report that. I can then resolve (=deploy), verify (=see in production) and close for each site separately.

Can Mylar provide a Clone this Bug button on the form tab, or even as a popup menu item in the Task List?</thetext>

    <thetext>committers, I was thinking of working on this.  here are my thoughts:

semantics
* only tasks can be cloned at this point, simple task and repository tasks (we'll worry about the complications of cloning other things later if people request that feature explicitly)
* only one task can be cloned at a time (i suppose people could want to clone multiple issues simultaneously, but it's much more straightforward to do it this way
* clone ~= opening a new issue of the same type and intelligently filled in up with reasonable defaults from the selected issue (see questions below)

ui
* In the task list, have a rlight-click context menu option - "Clone" - just below rename above the separator bar
* if multiple issues are selected, it will fail with an informative error msg dialog explaining only one can be selected
* if a non-task item is selected, it will fail with an informative error msg dialog explaining that only simple or repository tasks can be cloned

questions:
1) should the new issue have an automatic link to the issue it was cloned from?
2) should the new issue have an empty list of comments?  (i'm thinking that linking the issues and leaving the description empty would be best because the most common use case for clone I can think of is when creating a single issue across various branches of development for a particular project, which to me means the comments would be divergent, just as the code bases are)
3) if you're cloning an issue that you didn't report, should the cloned issue keep the original reporter or be the current user?

Is there anything else anyone wants to see this fix contain?</thetext>

    <thetext>I requested a button on the form page to implement the functionality in the browser. But...
the wider issue is bugtracking across multiple (n &gt;= 2) code streams: see http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/10/06/2248259 something which bugzilla offers only one solution for.
So maybe it should not be 'Clone this bug' (n += 1), but 'Cascade this bug' (1 += n), where you can copy the description to a range of products in one go: think of the list that pops up when doing a create new repository task.

1) Yes, the new issue should have a track back to the original, htough I'm not sure that this should be a 'dependency' (as in bugzilla with bug#, can only point back to the same bugzilla instance), but more of a 'related to" with a URL ref to the original issue. THis would allow cloning/cascading over mutiple repositories.

2) Empty comment list, it's a new issue. Cloning/cascading is just an convenience method.

3) Current user should be the reporter of the cloned issue, with maybe putting the original reporter on the cc list.

Next feature request would be to have a nice graphviz like View showing the graph or tree of related bugs color coded for resolution/status/priority ;-)</thetext>

    <thetext>My suggested solution for this issue was trying to keep things as simple as possible, while still hitting most of the common use cases.  The original description does mention, "or even as a popup menu item in the Task List", so that's what I went with.  However, I suppose this functionality could *also* be exposed as a clone button on an opened task.

1) It wasn't my intention to make this a generic, cross-type clone operation.  It meant meant to clone bugzilla issues -&gt; bugzilla issues, jira issues -&gt; jira issues, etc.  If this is a needed feature, can we get some other comments on it?

2) OK, good, we're in agreement.

3) Sounds like a good suggestion to me.</thetext>

    <thetext>Joseph, I believe the original intend of this bug was to support the native "clone" from bugzilla.

You came out with a more generic, repository-aware, multi-repository, very powerful solution, which is very good :)

I never had thought about this before, and sounds like a excellent idea.</thetext>

    <thetext>This sounds great so far. Regarding the ui, if we go with adding clone to the popup we can just disable the action in the case of multiple selections / invalid tasklistelement selections. </thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks guys.  I appreciate the feedback.   ; )

I think it's important to try and add value above and beyond what the underlying repos already provide - it gives people a greater incentive to use Mylar instead of more familar interfaces.  

Generally, I'd love to see Mylar completely blur the lines between what the different repositories provide.  Towards that end, my aim is consistency, and thus why I wanted to implement it as a generic layer for all types of tasks.</thetext>

    <thetext>This sounds excellent Maarten, and my thoughts are in line with the discussion above and I like the spec in comment#1.  Doing the simplest thing to get this working first is actually the generic thing, so here are some concrete steps for how I suggest proceeding, and then we can build this out from there:
1) Add clone action to Task List popup menu, this will grab the ITask object selected
2) Make the action reuse the MultiRepositoryAwareWizard for selecting the repository
3) After the repository is selected, if the repository has a new task editor (AbstractRepositoryConnector.canCreate..(..)) open that new editor and fill in all generic fields that you can
4) Provide an URL-based link back to the originating bug in the description, probably right at the top.

After this generic support is there, we will be able to delegate to connectors for duplicating connector-specific common fields.  This won't support turning repository tasks into local until bug 124321 is resolved.  Also, this solution could remove the need for bug 152211.

Also note that this functionality is similar to NewTaskFromErrorAction, since it also pre-populates the content of the task.  The attached context has the elements mentioned here as landmarks.</thetext>

 Hi Mik,
 
 this has been open for too long so I decided to help out here. 
&gt; 1) Add clone action to Task List popup menu, this will grab the ITask object
&gt; selected
See attachment image, I have used CMD-D for duplicate. Need to do a proper icon still.
&gt; 2) Make the action reuse the MultiRepositoryAwareWizard for selecting the
&gt; repository
Done, can create a new repository task
&gt; 3) After the repository is selected, if the repository has a new task editor
&gt; (AbstractRepositoryConnector.canCreate..(..)) open that new editor and fill in
&gt; all generic fields that you can
Only two text fields are easily settable, the rest are menu's
&gt; 4) Provide an URL-based link back to the originating bug in the description,
&gt; probably right at the top.
This works.

&gt; After this generic support is there, we will be able to delegate to connectors
&gt; for duplicating connector-specific common fields. 
I think we must add an single overrideable copyFrom(AbstractTask task) method where an editor can set all fields from the originating task, which then chains back up using super();
I'm a bit stuck now for what is in AbstractTask and what in the bugzilla one

    <thetext>I was planning on putting the copying in AbstractRepositoryTaskEditor method thus:
	/**
	 * Fill the new task editor from an existing task. Implement in subclasses to
	 * copy more fields when from the same or a 'friend' repository kind.
	 *
	 * @param task the task to copy fields from
	 */
	public void fillFromTask(AbstractTask task) {
		// ignore
		this.setSummaryText(task.getSummary() + " (cloned)");
		this.setDescriptionText("Clone of bug#" + CopyTaskDetailsAction.getTextForTask(task));
		// TODO set other standard repository fields here, like:
		// priority, severity, resolution, status, reporter , etc

		// TODO override this in the subclasses to set extra fields!
	}

Then this can be overridden in subclasses. But I also found AbstractNewRepositoryTaskEditor.
What is the difference and is that a better place?</thetext>

    <thetext>Patch applied.  Great stuff Maarten!  Please review my changes, in particular noting the following:
* Renamed action to CloneTaskAction
* Suppress showing it for local tasks because the interaction was a bit weird, but we consider adding
* Changed to use BaseSelectionListenerAction
* Changed to use target task's prefix (e.g. "issue" for JIRA vs. "bug" for Bugzilla)

Could you also provide a unit test that invokes this action on a MockRepositoryTask or a BugzillaTask and verifies that the summary was set properly on the new task?

All existing unit tests for actions only test the static methods in those Actions.
As I have put the copy in a overridable method in the editor, I can;' test, as there is no MockEditor :-(

    <thetext>Eugene: the patch was applied and was included in 2.1.

Maarten: a good way to test this would be to tell a new MockRepositoryTask to duplicate itself, then inspect the workbench to see what editors are open, find the new editor, and check that its Description was populated correctly.  It may be more straightforward for you to just create a MockTaskEditor as you imply.  Let me know if you would like additional pointers to similar test code.

I've tried to follow your tips. I create a new MockRepository and the copy one task.
To do this, I've refactored the run() method. run() now gets the selection form the TaskManager and calls a new
 static method cloneTask(AbstractTask task) that will do the repository selection and cloning.
 I can thus call cloneTask(task) with a task from the MockRepository in my unit test.
 
 However the new task editor can not be retrieved in this part as apparently UI threads are blocked during the unit test.
 So the new task editor only comes up once the unit test has failed :-(
 
This can occur in real life as well so I have added a waitUI() method like delay() in chapter 2.8 Writing Plug-in Tests in "Building Commercial Quality Plug-ins"

Next problem is that I feel that the Editor should derive from AbstractNewRepositoryTaskEditor, not AbstractRepositoryTaskEditor like in your code.
After all this is an editor for a task created but not yet present in a repository.

Then the actual copying of fields can be delegated to a method in every subclass of AbstractNewRepositoryTaskEditor, like BugzillaNewRepositoryTaskEditor.
This is the method to override to copy more fields than the two done now. 

Alas MockRepository returns a TaskEditor which is not a subsclass of AbstractNewRepositoryTaskEditor :-(</thetext>

Changed CloneTaskAction, delegated cloning, initial unit test

I've split the cloneTaskAction so it can be called easier from a unit test.

The MockRepository does not subclass AbstractNewRepositoryTaskEditor so fails and produces some text to copy paste.

The copying should be in the editor or subclass, as that allows the copying of more field sfor a known original Task type.</thetext>

    <thetext>The API that let's connectors initialize the new task editor from existing tasks has been merged. Maarten, please take a look at the changes that were made to CloneTaskAction and AbstractTaskDataHandler.cloneTaskData(). Please comment if the implementation is not sufficient to support cloning of tasks.

I'll look into improving support for JIRA and Bugzilla which still clone the old way that only sets summary and description but does not copy other attributes.

&gt; .... Please comment if
&gt; the implementation is not sufficient to support cloning of tasks.
In my old implementation I also put a '(Cloned)' suffix after the summary, but that is cosmetic.
I still wonder how we're going to handle moving a bug from say bugzilla to JIRA. use the adapter mechanism and create some sort of generic task?
I'm happy for now and see the value of creating api. Now you can clone a bug, create a bug from a comment, create a sub-task, all the time back linking to the originator.</thetext>

Yes, implementing mapping support for converting between different task models or to a more extensive generic format is certainly on the table for 3.0.</thetext>

    <thetext>steps to reproduce:
- create two (bugzilla-)queries; one of them should not produce any results
- create a working set
- add the query with results to it (but not the one without results)
- open the working set
- result: both queries show up

    <thetext>This is by design: empty queries always show up because we generally consider them to have something wrong with them that needs fixing (otherwise they should be deleted).  However, perhaps we should suppress this rule when in working set mode.</thetext>

    <thetext>Wou, I wasn't aware of this design thing. It doesn't seem obvious and there could be other good reasons why query is empty (i.e. per-user queries don't have bugs assigned).</thetext>

If I wanted to see my empty queries I can include them in the working set. The current behavior seems very unintuitive. 

I don't agree that there is something wrong with empty queries. I have queries for unresolved tasks assigned to me that come up empty every once in a while when I complete all tasks for that repository.</thetext>

    <thetext>+1.  Only question I have left is if we should just get rid of this rule alltogether.  While I recall it bering was requested (waaaay back) I'm concerned that it causes more confusion than it prevents.  It's extemely hard to understand why a query or category won't go away.</thetext>

    <thetext>+1 for removing this rule completely.

Arguably, queries with errors could have guaranteed visibility. Another thing about guaranteed visibility is that it would be a good idea to somehow shown triggered visibility rule in the tooltip.</thetext>

    <thetext>Another issue is that even with focus on workweek off, the user does not necessarily see all of their categories.  This can lead the user to believe that their query or category has disappeared or was deleted.  This happens when there is a category or query with only completed tasks under it and the completed tasks filter is on.

+1 for having both of these visibility issues fixed.</thetext>

Iteration 3

This patch does the following:
* Fixes empty query/category issue
* Fixes bug#197772
* Eliminates a redundant refresh of the task list upon apply/remove of interest filter

Mik if you could review that would be great.</thetext>

    <thetext>The proposed patch modifies the mark read/unread actions to only update state in the task list. Loading and merging of task data is delayed until the task is opened in an editor. As a side effect this allows to undo marking tasks read (bug 213206) as long as the task has not been opened in an editor. 

The patch has a high risk of undesired side-effects therefore I won't consider it for the 2.3 release.</thetext>

&gt; The proposed patch modifies the mark read/unread actions to only update state in
&gt; the task list. Loading and merging of task data is delayed until the task is
&gt; opened in an editor. As a side effect this allows to undo marking tasks read
&gt; (bug 213206) as long as the task has not been opened in an editor.

Steffen, can you please clarify, if I mark 5 sequential incoming changes on given task as read from the task list, is those changes still going to show in the task editor when it will be opened later for the same task?</thetext>

    <thetext>Rob, please note that the tests pass which implies that renaming of queries works correctly which is not the case (bug 212962). TaskWorkingSetTests already has tests for renaming that are commented out for that reason.</thetext>

    <thetext>As per conference call the following improvements were suggested:

 - fail silently when running a background operation (e.g. sync)
 - add repository decoration to password dialog to make it identifiable as a Mylyn dialog
 - add a link for opening repository properties from password dialog</thetext>

    <thetext>I have attached a screenshot of the new password dialog. The repository URL is a hyperlink that opens the repository properties dialog. The "Disconnect Repository" button puts the repository in offline mode and cancels the dialog.

Disabling of password prompting for background operations can be considered along with improving cancellation support for 3.0.

Mik, could you provide a more Mylynish icon for the wizard title? </thetext>

    <thetext>This is probably subjective, but here are few observations about the UI.

Disconnect repository on that dialog is somewhat breaking regular user interaction. It is not obvious from the UI if it is just an action after which user would need to close dialog using regular cancel or ok button, or "disconnect" button will actually close the UI. Maybe hyperlink or a checkbox would be better for this purpose.

Also, from the accessibility point of view it would be a good idea to show repository type in a plain text and not only repository icon (btw, icon might be better go into the dialog icon). I think space permits.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thoughts:
* The task repository looks a bit weird not being a field, because it looks like part of the lable.  But not a big deal.
* Remove the "Disconnect" button and instead but in a hyperlink that opens the Task Repositories view and a prompt along the lines of: "You can also disconnect this repository via the &lt;link&gt;Task Repositories&lt;/link&gt; view.  This interrupts workflow too but I believe that it is a better tradeoff and teaches the user how to disconnect/reconnect.</thetext>

password dialog mockup

Here are 3 screenshots for comparison:

- cvs password dialog
- current mylyn dialog (I've marked things that could be improved in red)
- draft mockup of suggested improvements (primarily around repository row, please ignore the difference in font styles)

I can work on a pach for implementing proposed mockup if it makes sense.</thetext>

- Keep the a lightweight password dialog that links to the heavy weight repository settings
- Change the title to "JIRA Repository Authentication"
- Link to repository properties by moving the link to the bottom of the dialog "Open Repository Properties"
- Make the UI consistent with the repository properties dialog

    <thetext>That look much better. Few comments though:

- I thought that it been decided on the conf. call to make password prompt look alike with repository properties dialog, i.e. use same layout to show server url and label, but use read-only widgets.
- Horizontal indentation for repository icon, user/password label, save password checkbox and "open properties" message need to be made the same.  Vertical indentation for "open properties" message look too big (will probably look better if reduced in half)
- Hyperlink to "Repository Properties" should not include word "Open" (compare it with similar links in Platform prefs. pages).
- There is inconsistent terminology used for that repository properties page. Menu is called "Properties", but dialog title says "Task Repository Settings" (compare with project or VCS properties dialogs, that all use titles like "Properties for XXX").
- The new foldable section on repository settings dialog seem odd and it would take less screen real estate without the foldable section.</thetext>

    <thetext> (In reply to comment #14)
&gt; - I thought that it been decided on the conf. call to make password prompt look
&gt; alike with repository properties dialog, i.e. use same layout to show server url
&gt; and label, but use read-only widgets.

I wasn't sure what the final decision was on the call and made the changes suggested in your screenshot. I think adding read-only widgets for URL and label will take away some of the simplicity of the dialog without any benefit.

&gt; - Horizontal indentation for repository icon, user/password label, save password
&gt; checkbox and "open properties" message need to be made the same.  Vertical
&gt; indentation for "open properties" message look too big (will probably look
&gt; better if reduced in half)

The horizontal indentation is consistent with the rest of the platform (e.g. CVS properties dialog). I agree that the vertical spacing could be reduced. I'll look into that.

&gt; - Hyperlink to "Repository Properties" should not include word "Open" (compare
&gt; it with similar links in Platform prefs. pages).

Unlike in the preferences dialog the link does not just switch to a different page but triggers an action that closes the current dialog. I think that using a verb in the hyperlink text makes that more clear. It is similar to Java -&gt; Compiler -&gt; "Configure Project Specific Settings".

&gt; - There is inconsistent terminology used for that repository properties page.
&gt; Menu is called "Properties", but dialog title says "Task Repository Settings"
&gt; (compare with project or VCS properties dialogs, that all use titles like
&gt; "Properties for XXX").

I agree that this should be made consistent.

&gt; - The new foldable section on repository settings dialog seem odd and it would
&gt; take less screen real estate without the foldable section.

My feeling is that disconnected is an advanced feature and used infrequently and should therefore be hidden by default. I would also like to add text that explains what disconnect means which would then justify the additional expandable section.</thetext>

    <thetext>Done. All background synchronization jobs now flag progress monitors when running as a background job (i.e. not forced / user initiated). Connectors can use Policy.isBackgroundMonitor() to check if an operation is running in the background. TaskRepositoryLocationUi uses that API to not show the password dialog for background operations.</thetext>

    <thetext>I think that Base64 would be the best choice for this encoding.  The only issue is that it makes the information stored on disk very unreadable.  To get around this bug, I URL encoded the Task id, then replaced any other offending characters with the base 64 version.  This seems to work.</thetext>

    <thetext>Here's how we could make the support for duplicate detectors generic.
1) Generic duplicate detectors are not specified by connectors but by plug-ins that understand the corresponding structure (e.g. a Java stack trace detector belongs in the a Java plugin, a natural language detector could go straight into the tasks.ui plug-in).  This can be done via the AbstractRepositoryConnector.performQuery(..) method that takes specialized parameters (e.g. a subtype of AbstractRepositoryQuery)
2) Connectors should be able to specify whether or not they support generic detection (i.e. have the search facilities needed).  Might make sense to do this via a method AbstractRepositoryConnector. 
3) Connector specific detectors can be supported to make use of the repositories duplicate detection facilities, if available.  In this case the connector itself would specify a custom duplicate detector.</thetext>

    <thetext>I have added a new class named AbstractSearchHandler to an internal package in tasks.core. Connectors can extend this class to provide a generic search facility for text by implementing this method:

 public abstract boolean queryForText(TaskRepository taskRepository, IRepositoryQuery query, TaskData taskData, String text);
 
Search handlers have to be registered by invoking TasksUiPlugin.getDefault().addSearchHandler(). Tasks UI contributes a generic stack trace detector that invokes the appropriate search handler if one exists.

We can consider making this API once the search handler interface has been stabilized.</thetext>

    <thetext>Committed first pass of refactoring the notification implementation. This re-enables notifications and incomings in tooltips for the new API. Notifications are now event based and only displayed for query synchronizations. 

The rendering is still the same. Text is cut off based on string length. Further improvements will be tracked on bug 205861.</thetext>

    <thetext>Steps to reproduce:

Open this bug in Mylyn's Bugzilla task editor. Or, create a new local task and paste them in there.

Note the following URLs, and how they open in a browser (or what chunk of text, onmouseover, becomes a link):

http://eclipse.org   -- good
(http://eclipse.org) -- bad
[http://eclipse.org] -- bad
{http://eclipse.org} -- bad
"http://eclipse.org" -- bad
'http://eclipse.org' -- bad
http://eclipse.org.  -- bad
http://eclipse.org,  -- bad

It's not as big a deal when it's at the end of a long URL's querystring. But when there's trailing punctuation on a domain name, folder, or page, you get a 404 or invalid domain.

Given that no URL ought to end with a period or comma (I'm guessing), and that if there's an opening bracket or quote there will be a closing one which can be omitted from the link, these seem like reasonable usecases.</thetext>

    <thetext>Great stuff Frank! I have applied your modifications of TaskUrlHyperlinkDetector. 

I would like to consider the remaining part of the patch as part of bug 167941. The modification of the rule parser has a risk of introducing a performance regression and we won't be able to do sufficient testing for that in the 3.0 release cycle.</thetext>

patch for javadoc comments on core mylyn 

patch for javadoc comments on core mylyn to minimize lines of code changed per patch.

Steffen, there are only a few comments -- sorry.  However, I put my name at the beginning of them -- not sure if that's necessary or not -- if it's not, obviously, feel free to remove it :-)</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks for the documentation and comments. I have applied the patch with minor modifications. I have removed the attributions for now as we usually don't add those to method comments. We can consider adding them to the @author tags in the class. Mik?

I'll consider a default implementation for AbstractRepositoryConnector.hasTaskChanged(). My current thinking is that we should make some of the details of the synchronization process explicitly and make connector implementors aware of the implementation as they are connector specific, e.g. how to check if a task has changed remotely. That's why I am currently leaning more toward having abstract methods even though the implementation in connectors may be the same.</thetext>

    <thetext>Yes, I realized that was the reason for letting the connectors figure out their own implementation, but thought it might be useful to just point people to an implementation -- maybe a sample of the code in the comments would have been more appropriate.
In terms of comment attribution -- I just wasn't sure what the right thing to do was, so added my name just in case -- I am perfectly happy if it doesn't appear there (in fact more so :-))</thetext>

I logged the original bug using bugmenot.com

very specifically, there are two strings:
1. Handle
2. Name

Handle gets renamed but not the Name

Hence the sorting is correct (by Handle), but the display value is incorrect (by Name)

It is a blocker because this blocks me from using Mylyn with more than one Bugzilla query. All newly-cloned queries get tagged with the same name and there is no way to differentiate between the queries.

    <thetext>Looks great. Here two suggestions for improvement:

- The JavaDoc comments should be full sentences, e.g. "Extracts the resource name for the matched text. Subclasses should override this method if... ." This page has more detailed information about writing JavaDoc comments and good examples: http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingapispecs/index.html .
- AbstractResourceHyperlinkExtension.getReourceExpressions() should be renamed to getResourceExpressions().

    <thetext>Is the UnknownResourceHyperlinkExtension a generic resource hyperlink detector? If so it should probably be renamed to ResourceHyperlinkExtension.

The hyperlinking for Cpp might be out of the scope of the Mylyn project particularly if this would require coupling to CDT. The current policy is to support integrations for components of the Eclipse SDK distribution. Once the extension point is stabilized it could be interesting to add this to the Mylyn CDT integration though.</thetext>

&gt; Is the UnknownResourceHyperlinkExtension a generic resource hyperlink detector?
&gt; If so it should probably be renamed to ResourceHyperlinkExtension.

yup, it intents to represent unidentified resource, e.g. *.html, *.txt. I agree that it should be renamed to ResourceHyperlinkExtension.

sounds good, the design may also cover other resources, e.g. bug 240442 </thetext>

    <thetext>Let's try to keep patches a bit smaller. Can you reattach a patch that only has the grouping strategy (none of the ui or tests)? Please take a look at bug 244371 for a suggestion how to implement a test. I think the grouping strategy should only work based on a list of ITaskComment objects. You make a protected method hasIncomingChanes(ITaskComment) to enable clients to plugin their own implementation (that may use the task data model) by overridding the method. </thetext>

&gt; Created an attachment (id=110188)
&gt; CommentGroupStrategy
&gt; 
&gt; I think what I need is TaskDataModel instead of a list of TaskAttribute

because it needs to make sure all incoming changes are in the "Current" group (there are cases when it will go to "Recent" or "Older"). I know it will make more sense to just group a list of TaskAttribute. But I think the CommentGroupStrategy should be closely rely on TaskEdtiorCommentPart.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks! Patch applied. Sorry, I was a bit in hurry when writing my last comment. The reason I suggest to avoid a dependency on TaskDataModel is that it makes CommentGroupStrategy easier to test and more generic for reuse. It is difficult to provide a stub implementation of TaskDataModel that provides only the necessary data to CommentGroupStrategy without testing the whole process of downloading task data, creating a working copy and a task data model. Basically the smaller a test case is and the fewer functionality it relies on that is unrelated to what is being tested the more reliable the test case will be and it becomes significantly easier to diagnose a failure.

In this case the required input to testing the grouping strategy is a list of comments and whether a comment is new. The latter criteria is encapsulated in TaskDataModel. In order to "extract" this functionality from the class (to not add a dependency on the whole class) the hasIncomingChanges() method could be split out into an interface or encapsulated in a protected method in CommentGroupStrategy.</thetext>

* when a task editor is first opened and the comments section has not been expanded, pressing either of these buttons does nothing.  I would expect the 'expand-all' button to cause all comments to be shown, or at the very least the 'current' comments.
* when the comments section is expanded, the 'expand-all' button still does nothing, though the collapse-all button appears to work</thetext>

    <thetext>(In reply to comment #3)
&gt; Thanks Owen. I have committed a change along the lines of your patch that makes
&gt; CommentGroupStrategy work based on ITaskComment only so it does not require a
&gt; reference to TaskDataModel at all.

Wow...thats much better! Greate work, Steffen.

A minor point: If CommentGroupStrategy.hasIncomingChanges(..) always return false, it would be possible that  "current" &amp; "recent" subsections are both toggled open, if current user's last comment is not the latest incoming comment. For example,

-Recent
	-incoming 1 &lt;- this is first incoming comment
	-incoming 2
-Current
	-incoming 3 &lt;- this is current user's latest comment
	-incoming 4
	
That's why we might need to ensure all incoming comments are grouped in the "current" subsection before we search the user's last comment (CommentGroupStrategy.hasIncomingChanges(..) should return true if it should).</thetext>

    <thetext>ExtensibleTaskEditorCommentPart.getCommentGroupStrategy() overrides hasIncomingChanges() with the proper implementation that queries the model. I am still not sure if we should group all incomings in the current section. In the case of viewing a new bug that has 200 comments for instance this becomes very slow and most of the time the user is only interested in the most recent comments, i.e. it would be sufficient to expand Recent and Current.  </thetext>

    <thetext>I think we can address this bug independently of the editor refactoring. From a quick look at the code most of the changes required should contain TaskTextViewerConfiguration. The class will need a reference to the repository and set the text attributes based on task status. It will require a bit of additional parsing to extract the bug id but at best we would be able to leverage the hyperlink detection code for that.

I have two concerns though:

- Performance might be an issue: profiling indicated that tokenizing of comments is already impacting task editor startup time and additional task list lookups might make it noticeably slower.

- Bug 200613 which suggests to allow connectors to contribute custom parsing rules is still unresolved and there could be some overlap with generalizing hyperlink detection and highlighting in the text viewers which would affect this bug.

That said you are welcome to experiment with a fix but it might take some time and a few iterations until a good solution emerges. As a first pass you could try to limit changes to TaskTextViewerConfig and we could use that as driver for generalizing the parsing code (bug 200613).

Patch

This Patch use StyleRange.strikeout for completed Tasks.

I found some problems with the current implementation. If you look at an comment with more the one Hyperlink you find that in  the WEB Interface all Hyperlinks are shown. But in Taskeditor we only activate one Hyperlink.

Should we fix this?</thetext>

screenshot

That's a good start but it has some funny side effects (see screenshot). I noticed that the strikethrough decoration is only shown if you hover over a resolved task but maybe that's better than always showing it?

Please file a new bug for the problem you were seeing with multiple hyperlinks and provide an example how to reproduce it.</thetext>

    <thetext> (In reply to comment #10)
&gt; That's a good start but it has some funny side effects (see screenshot). I
&gt; noticed that the strikethrough decoration is only shown if you hover over a
&gt; resolved task but maybe that's better than always showing it?

I'd like to have it always shown, but it is a personal preference.

 (In reply to comment #13)
&gt; Willian, could you test the if the strike-through works for you when you hover
&gt; over links to resolved bugs?

Works fine for me.

There is a minor glitch, that the strikethrough only appears if the target task is present in task list. For example, bug#1 does not appear with the decoration here, because it is not captured in any of my queries, and consequently there is not a way to determine if it is resolved or not without making a network connection, I guess.</thetext>

&gt; - Bug 200613 which suggests to allow connectors to contribute custom parsing
&gt; rules is still unresolved and there could be some overlap with generalizing
&gt; hyperlink detection and highlighting in the text viewers which would affect this
&gt; bug.
&gt; 
&gt; That said you are welcome to experiment with a fix but it might take some time
&gt; and a few iterations until a good solution emerges. As a first pass you could
&gt; try to limit changes to TaskTextViewerConfig and we could use that as driver for
&gt; generalizing the parsing code (bug 200613).

I start looking on this and have one point

RepositoryTextScanner use rules for coloring hyperlinks but BugzillaConnector.findHyperlinks use a regexp Pattern. So by example the text  'some bug 123' is not colored but if you move the mouse over you see the hyperlink.

Should I try do develop a new method which can be used from both points so that we can allow an overwrite later on.

Eugene, if iI see it rigtht there is a problem with this. hyperlink detector is only triggered by mouse move and highlighting is triggered by RepositoryTextScanner. This meens that hyperlink detector results are not available by the time RepositoryTextScanner needs this.</thetext>

1. Prove of concept for comment#6

First version of custom parsing rules. Based on character scanner.
TaskRule is an extention of SingleLineRule with Tasknumber detection between StartSequence and EndSequence.

Next step:

Change TaskRule to use a regexp for detection. 

Currently I use other colors for better visual feedback.</thetext>

    <thetext>There is another concern in regards to striketrough. Basically we can only show it if task data is available locally, so it is somewhat misleading to not show striketrough if task data is not available. So it may make sense to use different decoration or tooltip in case when we don't know if task is completed or not.</thetext>

    <thetext>Great that you got the syntax highlighting working with regular expressions, Frank! I'll try to apply to my workspace in the next few days. Did you notice any slow down while browsing bugs or while entering new comments?  

I am not sure that the TaskRepository is the best place for storing the hyperlink expressions. Hyperlinks are a UI concern and should be part of the connector UI. The fact that it is not loaded when editors are restored presents a problem that we might have to solve first before we preceding with this bug. Rob and I briefly discussed an idea  to delay editor initialization, e.g. display a message "Loading..."  in the editor  until the lazy startup in Tasks UI has completed and create the controls after that.  

I would suggest to fail gracefully for now, i.e. disable syntax highlighting for the editors that are restored on startup. TaskEditor.addPages() works the same way: If the connector UI is not there the task label (e.g. "Bug" or "Issue") is not displayed in the editor title. It only affects one task editor if it is the top most editor when the workbench is restored.

Setting the priority back to P4 since this it is likely that this bug won't be resolved in time for 2.3 due to the technical challenges.  </thetext>

correction from comment#29

Following change:
- AbstractRepositoryConnectorUi now used for the Method getHyperlinkRegularExpression
- correction of the color I used for debug. Now I use ACTIVE_HYPERLINK_COLOR for normal bugs and HYPERLINK_COLOR for bugs not in tasklist.
(In reply to comment #29)
&gt; Great that you got the syntax highlighting working with regular expressions,
&gt; Frank! I'll try to apply to my workspace in the next few days. Did you notice

I know that it is slower, but I think that this is not so extreme that you can notice this.

&gt; I would suggest to fail gracefully for now, i.e. disable syntax highlighting for
&gt; the editors that are restored on startup.

OK now the TaskRule is skipped if no connector UI is present.

What do you think about this:

In RepositoryTextScanner we can do the followning 

Set the parentEditor Message with a text like
"Hyperlinkdetection is not present.  Press synchronize button (right) to activate."

But that meens we must pass the parentEditor from AbstractTaskEditorPage to RepositoryTextScanner.</thetext>

&gt; - AbstractRepositoryConnectorUi now used for the Method
&gt; getHyperlinkRegularExpression

I would prefer to reuse the existing AbstractRepositoryConnectorUi.findHyperlinks() API instead of adding a new method. That way connector implementors would have a single place to specify the patterns and the API would not be tied to regular expressions. Would it work to pass the connectorUi object to TaskRule? 

&gt; - correction of the color I used for debug. Now I use ACTIVE_HYPERLINK_COLOR for

That sounds like a good idea. In addition we could add a tooltip, e.g. "Task not found in task list, click here to add".

That's a great idea. This should be done in TaskEditor as it affects other parts of the editor as well. We could make the message more generic, e.g.: "The editor may contain incomplete information. Click here to refresh."</thetext>

Currently getHyperlinkRegularExpression() is used in

2) RepositoryTextScanner Constructor which only need the regular expressions.
I don't see how we can easily get rid of getHyperlinkRegularExpression and use findHyperlinks instead.

&gt; That sounds like a good idea. In addition we could add a tooltip, e.g. "Task not

Please tell me how I can add a task to the unmatched container and I implement this.

    <thetext>I experimented with the patch for a bit but couldn't get it to work reliably. After looking at the RuleBasedScanner code more closely it seems that this will be hard to get working with regular expressions. The scanner goes through the text sequentially and delegates to the rules for each character that it scans until a matching token is found. The hyperlinks act more like scanners themselves by matching chunks of text against regular expressions. It might be worth investigating a custom implementation of ITokenScanner that is optimized to work with the hyperlink detectors.

It would be great if you could try to implement this. It should be possible to use regular expressions for URL detection as well as quoting (i.e. lines that start with '&gt;'). Try the most simple implementation as a first pass to evaluate if this will satisfy performance requirements etc. Even if it doesn't scale for editing text it might still be feasible to do it for read-only comments.

    <thetext>Another problem that is related to highlighting in the task editor (bug 146964 comment 30):

Hyperlink coloring can be incorrect until the hyperlink is hovered over, at which point, the coloring is removed entirely.

i.e.  (bug #24) for testing :-)

Note that this seems to only happen in the description.</thetext>

    <thetext>David, this is remotely related to the WikiText integration. The goal is to decorate text in comments that is hyperlinked, such as bug references (e.g. bug 167941) or URLs. In addition bug references to resolved bugs should appear in strike through. The detection code is repository specific and usually implemented using regular expression (see findHyperlinks() in  java class AbstractRepositoryConnectorUi).

Do you have ideas how to implement a regular expression based ITokenScanner and how to integrate this with the existing parsing in wikitext?</thetext>

    <thetext>The ITokenScanner could be implemented by delegating detection to the AbstractConnectorUi.  It seems that the concrete implementations already use regex to find the hyperlinks.  That said, I'm not sure if an ITokenScanner is the best way to go.  We may be better off using document annotations and an annotation painter.  This is what WikiText does for other types of hyperlinks.  I'll take a look.</thetext>

    <thetext>That sounds good. Can you point me at the classes in wikitext that handle the annotations? I would be interested in understanding how that works.</thetext>

    <thetext>I'm still not sure which is the best approach.  

The Annotation+painter approach is probably simplest, but somewhat of a hack as you won't be altering the text presentation directly.  This is how error/warning markers are painted (eg: the spell check).  To understand how WikiText uses these you should take a look at the following:

* for creating annotations: java class HtmlTextPresentationParser
* for registering a custom annotation-based painter: java class HtmlViewer (see the @initPainter()@ method)

Otherwise you'll have to alter the text presentation.  For WikiText this is done differently depending on what's being parsed.  

* For an editable source viewer, see java class MarkupTokenScanner
* For a read-only source viewer, see java class HtmlTextPresenter (not HTMLTextPresenter, as per bug 244352)
* For viewers that use a @RuleBasedScanner@, you may just need to implement a rule.  Unfortunately rules are extremely difficult to use with regex, since they use ICharacterScanner.  In the past I've implemented a regex that works over ICharacterScanner, but it wasn't pretty.

As you can see, it's not a trivial undertaking.  The annotation-based stuff is definitely the simler path, as it should work with any viewer regardless of how the TextPresentation is calculated.</thetext>

&gt; David, this is remotely related to the WikiText integration. The goal is to
&gt; decorate text in comments that is hyperlinked, such as bug references (e.g. bug
&gt; 167941) or URLs. In addition bug references to resolved bugs should appear in
&gt; strike through.

Other than strike through what kind of decoration did you have in mind?  And should the decoration change after opening the editor if the status of the linked task changes?</thetext>

    <thetext>It would be okay if the decoration was updated on editor refresh but if it could change when the task changes that would be even better. I can't think of a use case for making it change depending on whether a task is open or not.

It would be nice if anything that is clickable would appear in a different color, e.g. blue. Without the WikiText extensions enabled this currently works for hyperlinks (e.g. http://eclipse.org) and tasks (e.g. 214529) but is hard coded in the java class RepositoryTextScanner at the moment.</thetext>

patch that adds strikethrough style to task hyperlinks

Patch does the following:

* creates java class TaskHyperlinkTextPresentationManager, a class that can be used with any SourceViewer to manage task hyperlink styles
* hooks TaskHyperlinkTextPresentationManager into ExtensibleRichTextAttributeEditor of the sandbox

The patch works great, except that it depends on bug 244442.  In my testing with a hacked fix for bug 244442 in BugzillaConnectorUi this patch works well.

In my previous discussion of the solution I had forgotten about ITextPresentationListener.  Of course, Eclipse APIs almost always has everything you need...  this patch makes use of ITextPresentationListener, which is the intended way to add this kind of functionality.</thetext>

patch that fixes the first-time-presentation issue

(In reply to comment #57)
&gt; I have committed the patch but moved the code from the sandbox into tasks.ui. I
&gt; noticed that the strikethrough only appears when I hover over the task for the
&gt; first time. David, do you have any ideas?

try this patch, it works for me.

the problem is that the presentation was already computed before the manager was installed.  This one-liner fixes the issue.</thetext>

The reason is the comments under each subsections are built lazily. WHile toggling the main section, we need to also toggle the subsecions before EditorUtil.findControl()</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks for your help David. Huge refactoring patches like this are difficult to review. It's usually easier if refactorings are done by the committer who is responsible for the component that is being changed. I would also like to review the code and API while moving it from the sandbox so I'll take this bug for now. </thetext>

&gt; Thanks for your help David. Huge refactoring patches like this are difficult to
&gt; review. 

What I've found works well is to apply the patch, then compare the source tree against the latest revision in the repository.  The Eclipse compare editor is great at showing differences across multiple files.

&gt; I would also like to review
&gt; the code and API while moving it from the sandbox so I'll take this bug for now.

Ok, great.  I look forward to seeing this one completed.

    <thetext>I have moved the extension point and merged the code from the extensible task editor classes in the sandbox. Note that I have temporarily disabled default associations between repositories and markup languages until the configuration UI is moved into main as well. The configuration from the context menu is now available for all repositories and WikiText already works JIRA and Trac!</thetext>

    <thetext>I realize that Mylyn isn't out there to make a really great generic tooltip class, but by making a couple of methods protected access I'm able to re-use a lot of the code, which saved me a bunch of time.</thetext>

    <thetext>Nathan, could you describe your use-case for extending the tooltip? We can make these methods protected but please note that TaskListTooltip is an internal class that may (and is likely to) change in the future.</thetext>

    <thetext>I've got a tree viewer like the tasklist with one level of categorization.  I had copied TaskListTooltip initially, but then noticed that I wasn't making any changes to most of the methods I was copying.  I realize it's internal.</thetext>

    <thetext>Just to clarify: the reason why I asked for a use case is that we have another request for making the tool tip more extensible (bug 197345). Apparently this use case is entirely different and is best addressed by making the methods protected.</thetext>

    <thetext>Nathan, I have made the changes suggested in your patch. I only made a slight modification to the method name for creating the composite: it is called  createToolTipContentAreaComposite() instead of createSurface(). Please verify that I didn't miss anything. </thetext>

    <thetext>A couple of thought from reviewing the UI:

It's better to avoid the forms look and feel in dialogs, it is inconsistent with "native" controls (see Linux screenshot). I believe the only reason the FormToolkit is used in the dialog is for expandable composites but I am not even that is strictly needed so it maybe a good idea to remove it from the API all together.

I have looked for other examples in the Eclipse UI where a bold font is used to indicate the default but could not find any. I think appending "(default)" is sufficient to highlight the default option.

On first sight I found it difficult to figure out how to disable the extension. It was not obvious to me that "Plain Text" does this. How about replacing the first option by an "Enable" checkbox?</thetext>

    <thetext>(In reply to comment #2)
&gt; It's better to avoid the forms look and feel in dialogs, it is inconsistent with
&gt; "native" controls (see Linux screenshot). I believe the only reason the
&gt; FormToolkit is used in the dialog is for expandable composites but I am not even
&gt; that is strictly needed so it maybe a good idea to remove it from the API all
&gt; together.

I incorrectly assumed that the FormToolkit was in there for a reason.  I can re-work this one to avoid using the form toolkit.

&gt; I have looked for other examples in the Eclipse UI where a bold font is used to
&gt; indicate the default but could not find any. I think appending "(default)" is
&gt; sufficient to highlight the default option.

okay

&gt; On first sight I found it difficult to figure out how to disable the extension.
&gt; It was not obvious to me that "Plain Text" does this. How about replacing the
&gt; first option by an "Enable" checkbox?

Can do.  Perhaps Mik can provide feedback on this, as 'Plain Text' was his suggestion. 
To me 'Plain Text' is very intuitive.... how does 'Enable' relate to editor settings?  There's no text to indicate what's being enabled or disabled.</thetext>

I looked at some code from JDT (bug 253142) and was surprised that they actually use a form toolkit in the dialog as well but set foreground and background color to null. At the moment I am unsure whether it's a good idea to expose it in the API or if the actual toolkit should only be accessible through wrapper methods (e.g. for registering key and focus listeners on the widget). We can discuss this further on bug 253142.

Good point. I was thinking too much from a technical perspective. Plain Text is actually more descriptive, so it makes sense to leave it the way it is.

    <thetext>Great patch! I have applied it with minor modifications: Moved TaskEditorExtensionSettingsContribution to editors package and fixed copyright headers. Fixed minor bug that caused TaskEditorExtensionSettingsContribution.createControl() to append default label twice.

Note that I have disabled the property page of the local task repository for now. The local task editor does not yet support the task editor extension which should be resolved first.</thetext>

    <thetext>I don't recommend to use Bugzilla for creating these tests. The simpler the test is the easier it is to understand and verify that it is actually correct. Since creating a mock class could be difficult I would recommend to change the implementation to ease testability (see bug 244359 comment 7).

To run connector tests you need to setup a credentials.properties file:

    <thetext>I find that having the "Current" subsection under Comments offers little value but takes up space. How about this:

 - Group comments under Current directly under the Comments section
 - Modify the behavior of the "+" button on the comment section to expand all current comments on first click and all comments on subsequent clicks

In addition to taking up less space this change would get rid of the "+" and "-" buttons on the subsection which I sometimes find easy to confuse with the buttons on the section header.</thetext>

    <thetext>Related to this bug:
I just pressed the + button on all comments when the comments were showing recent and current.  This behaved as expected, expanding all comments.  However, pressing - to fold all comments still leaves each section (recent and current) expanded, which is not what I expected.  I would prefer if the global - folded everything, not just the comments.  Is this the intended behaviour?  Just wanted to give some feedback... looks cool otherwise!</thetext>

a patch that fixed the proposition comment #2

Great point David! This is something we didn't cover before. The initial intention was to keep the existing way: the "old" collapse all only close the comments without closing the section. So now we only close all the comments without closing the subsections.

Steffen, in this patch, I implemented to close all the subsections when pressing the collapse all button. Another proposition would be to only close the "older" &amp; the "recent" and leave "current" inacative, since our goal is to always keep "current" open?</thetext>

&gt; Sorry Owen, I missed that change. I have just committed a change that removes
&gt; the current section. We'll need to figure out how to adjust the behavior of the
&gt; expand buttons based on these changes.

n/m. I think it makes sense to collapse all subsections when clicking the "collapse-all" button though.

removing the current section will definitely make the design simpler. But programmers couldn't expend-all current comments at once (maybe add another button on the main section toolbar). Besides, when all subsections + comments are expended, there are no boundary between the "recent" comments and the "current" comments. Thats a bit confusing.</thetext>

    <thetext>I think that the expand all button should first expand all current comments on the first click and then on a second click expand all comments.   Otherwise users can't expand all current comments, and expanding all comments is too expensive in terms of screen size.</thetext>

Patch to progressively expand the comments when the expand all button is pressed.

First click expands current, second click expands recent, third expands older.  Expansion is sensitive to the current expansion state of the comments.  Unfortunately, there is no clean way to access the Recent and Older sections and so the code to get these sections is not as clean as it should be.</thetext>

    <thetext>I had to make a few changes to the current implementation to improve performance. Generally the button should work based on the state of the UI and not rely on particular sections to be present. Have you tried iterating over the widgets to check if all comments in the current section are expanded to determine the behavior of the button? I would prefer that over keeping separate state in an integer which is tricky to synchronize when the user collapses or expands comment/sections manually. </thetext>

&gt; I had to make a few changes to the current implementation to improve
&gt; performance. 
The pre-patch implementation? or was the patch causing performance problems?
&gt; Generally the button should work based on the state of the UI and
&gt; not rely on particular sections to be present. 
The button does work based on the state of the UI, I can work on making it not rely on particular sections.
&gt; Have you tried iterating over the
&gt; widgets to check if all comments in the current section are expanded to
&gt; determine the behavior of the button? 
This is very similar to what the code does.  The code checks the state of the UI when the button is pushed by checking the expansion state of the "older" and "recent" sections.  It does not check individual comments, however, only the section.
&gt; I would prefer that over keeping separate
&gt; state in an integer which is tricky to synchronize when the user collapses or
&gt; expands comment/sections manually.
The state is not "kept" in an integer, it is recalculated each time the button is pushed by examining the expansion state of the UI. 

From you comments, it seems the main complaint is having the code rely on the presence of certain sections.  If I make the code more generic by removing references to these sections will you have any other issues with the patch?  If so, what (so I can address them at the same time).</thetext>

    <thetext>The performance changes were unrelated to the patch. I just noticed slowness when I tested expanding comments. Patch looks good, I misread the first patch you submitted not realizing the the integer state is recalculated each time the button is pressed.

One thing I noticed with the latest patch is that it expands all comments if I click the button when the Comments section is collapsed.</thetext>

    <thetext>I think you should only count a section as expanded if all comments in that section are expanded. The counting should also be based on the same assumption that is made in expandAllComments(), i.e. sections are counted bottom up.

Consider this scenario for instance: Collapse all and expand the Older section, then press the button. As a result of pressing the expand button Older will be collapsed and Recent and all current comments will be expanded.</thetext>

Patch v3 to change + behavior

Should fix some of the issues we discussed.  However, this code is starting to grow more complex as there are several special cases and it is not easy to access the UI widgets directly.  As Steffen suggested, this class should be put on the list of classes to refactor in the near future.</thetext>

    <thetext>The patch looks good. I am hesitant to apply it though as it tracks comment groupings by number ranges. After looking at the class I now believe that it would be better to refactor the data structures first which currently don't capture the mapping between the data model (attributes) and UI representation (subsections, comment editors etc.). This would also help with other e.g. model-based search, bug 242969).</thetext>

    <thetext>Great!  I just tested it out and it seems to perform a lot faster as well, did you do any profiling?  For a bug with 90 comments it used to take ~10 seconds to expand and now it takes 0.5 seconds.  Nice!

Cool stuff guys! Nice hack in TaskEditorCommentPart.expandAllComments()! 

Just curious: is the user story changed? now the "current" group takes the last 12 comments instead of taking the comments since current user's last comment...</thetext>

screenshot of the new comment group strategy (bug 238038)

But it seems "showing the last 12 comments" overshadow "showing the comments since the user last commented" (always showing the last 12 comments)? In the screenshot, should it only display comment #70 and #71 instead of the last 12 comments (comments since the user last commented has a higher priority)?</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks for the patches! I have applied the patch for tasks.ui. I am not sure about the externalization of the date format in the tasks.core patch. Ideally there would be a single format specified somewhere that would be used by the task editor as well as the task list. I'll bring this up within the Mylyn team.</thetext>

    <thetext>I have reviewed and refactored TaskDragSourceListener and TaskListDropAdapter. The task list now properly handles local transfers, text transfers and url transfers. I have removed the ability to drop files on to the task list. We can revisit this later once the task/query import implementation has been fixed.

Dragging tasks, queries or categories out of the task list creates a mylyn-tasks.xml.zip which is a task list file which contains the selected items only.</thetext>

    <thetext>Upon drag and drop of a context zip file onto a task in the tasklist a validation is performed on the file to ensure it has a context, this validation now fails since it is looking for a bogus context with handle 'temp', hence the drop of context onto the target task is failing. This raises the additional question of what to do when multiple contexts exist in the file. We should likely present a context preview/selection dialog allowing the user to choose the appropriate context.</thetext>

    <thetext>I can fix it in a number of ways:

Since it is only a context filename that can vary in ZIP file then I can detect, that if filename is not "repositories.xml" or "tasklist.xml", then it is a context file. Not very good solution, I think, it can break again if a new data file is added to the arhive later. Fast enough to do, thought.

The second option is to make readContext() to work the old way(process the very first ZipEntry) if handleIndentifier in SaxContextReader.readContext() is "temp" (or "", or null, or what to choose?).

The third option is to pass to ContextCorePlugin.getContextManager().isValidContextFile(file) also a handle of a target AbstractTask, to make the externalizer use legal handle, not a "temp" one. Nevertheless, matching task's handle and context's file name in zip file can fail. This can occur if the handle was changed (can it happen?) or the context was taken from another task.

Another way would be trying to read all files in the archive and fix SaxContextContentHandler() so it would notify/stop processing, if a xml file's content is not a context description.

Which way should I go?

As to the question of many contexts in one file, as I understand, currently it's not possible: for each task a separate file is created with a single context inside.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks Jevgeni, if you don't have time just pass back to me. I think your second option of just using the first available context is appropriate for now provided null is passed for the handle. Is it feasible (in the future) to put contexts into a context folder within the zip making it easier to get 'just contexts' from the zip (for when we have multiple tasks/contexts in a single zip?</thetext>

&gt; Thanks Jevgeni, if you don't have time just pass back to me. I think your
&gt; second option of just using the first available context is appropriate for now
&gt; provided null is passed for the handle. Is it feasible (in the future) to put

&gt; contexts' from the zip (for when we have multiple tasks/contexts in a single
&gt; zip?
&gt; 


Right, I was also thinking about this option, it should be quite simple to implement. Nevertheless, I would prefer touching xml files's root element to ensure that the the Mylyn is actually working with a correct context file. Matching by filenames seems to me a bit unsafe, but this can be only my gut feeling :)</thetext>

Agreed. Will look at patch as soon as I get the go ahead from Mik.

    <thetext>Had a look Jevgeni.  If the first zip entry is something other than a context, a bogus context is constructed. I think we need to do more work to get a proper context out of the file if it exists. Scheduling for 2.3 since we're so late in the 2.2 cycle.</thetext>

    <thetext>Such drop down will look really crowded with my 20 repositories. Maybe you could show the last 5 and also take active working set into the account.

I am always using Alt-Shift-N (then Enter in most of the cases). It is faster then toolbar and works when Task List view is not visible.</thetext>

Here is what the ui is looking like. Since we can't get a single image descriptor for the repo icon and brand overlay in one, I've opted for the branding icon.</thetext>

    <thetext>This is looking good, but we can't have just the overlay icon because it is too small.  Depending on how you are creating the images, there should be some mechanism for you to get a composite image descriptor or image.  See TaskElementLabelProvider for examples.

Regarding the structure, here's what I think we should go with:

================
Local
Eclipse
Mozilla Bugzilla
----------
Query
Category
----------
Add Task Repository...  (make sure you use an existing message since we'll probably change this to New...).

    <thetext>Okay thanks Mik, I've now got regular repository icons with branding overlays in the menu (via CompositeImageDescriptor).

I'm not sure that Query and Category make sense in this button.  I would expect to find these under a separate folderImage+ button.  </thetext>

Fixed.

&gt; The other thing that is really important is that the product is initialized
&gt; based on the current selection similar to how this used to work for the Bugzilla
&gt; product page.
I've been looking into this and the problem I've run up against here is that the TasksUiUtil api accepts a ITaskMapping rather than a ISelection.  But at the point of creating a new task now, we don't have connector specific knowledge of how to create a mapping (in the case of a non-task selection).  If we were only concerned with task selections this would be straight forward using connector.getTaskMapping(taskData), but we want this to work for queries as well.  So I've merged the code to generate the Bugzilla specific mapping into NewBugzillaTaskWizard.  Other solutions entail adding api to extract a mapping from a selection.

Thanks Rob. That is exactly the intended approach with the current API. The new task wizard is the UI component that knows how to create a task mapping from the current workbench state.

    <thetext>Let's first discuss the fate of that progress bar, since it overlaps with integration with planning tools and facilities, which we haven't quite figured yet.  I think we should resolve this one way or another in the 3.2 timeframe so tentatively assigning to you.</thetext>

    <thetext>Hmm. Should it have repository url too?
I also recall there was an issue opened for linking Eclipse projects to the repositories tht was also suggestin some pluggable relolution mehanisms. E.g. one could use Maven data and search trough stack trace and link package names to product artifacts and extract issue tracking system location from Maven's poms for those artifcats.</thetext>

    <thetext>Balazs: could you make this your next priority?  The Welcome stuff is great, but this would be really helpful to have in 2.0 along with the related updates to bug 183606.  Please let me know if you would like some pointers about how we use and create extension points.  This one would go into ..mylar.tasks.ui/schema/repositories.exsd</thetext>

    <thetext>An extension point may not be the right way of doing this, because it does not support the producer/consumer separation.  For example, an Eclipse-based product may want to handle all bug reports made against Platform in order to ensure response time.  For this reason I think that the mapping would best be specified in an external resource (e.g. a plug-in to tracker/product mapping file), and could provide support for things like wildcard matching (e.g. all Errors from package org.eclipse.mylyn.jira.* plug-ins should be logged to repository foo).  EPP distros could then specify bugs.eclispe.org, with appropriate product/component mappings, but redistributions would be free to do their own thign.  Syntax could be something like:

   pluginPattern="org.eclispe.mylyn.jira.*"
   repository="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs"
   attributes="Product=Mylyn;Component=Jira;Version=2.1"</thetext>

    <thetext>Mik, we really need to support project/product and component/module at the task model. Also, I believe this metadata about component mapping could came from other sources, so it should be possible to plug custom adapter from that information instead/in addition to reading it from proprietary files.</thetext>

    <thetext>Eugene: it would be nice if we could standardize on project/product and component/module, but we currently support connectors that have no notion of that.  For example, an agile project management tool might only use the following attributes:

   attributes="Kind=Defect;Version=1.0;"
   
We could consider having an optional product= and component= mapping, and having the repository connector specify what that maps to, if appropriate, but this is not for sure an overall win.  It would be a win for many Bugzilla and JIRA installs though, and similar bug/issue trackers, so we can consider it.</thetext>

&gt; component/module, but we currently support connectors that have no notion of
&gt; that.  For example, an agile project management tool might only use the
&gt; following attributes:
&gt; 
&gt; attributes="Kind=Defect;Version=1.0;"

I don't see how those are useful for mapping to products. Besides, we have 3 or even 4 Mylyn's reference connectors that have notion of project/product and module.

Exactly. We are missing this component/project mapping not only for this purpose. I can think of a dozen of other places when that would be useful.</thetext>

    <thetext>Can someone summarize the use case for this enhancement and use of the proposed enhancement? 

From previous comments it seems like the assumption to have this extension point declared in every plugin, which seem like tough call for all existing platform plugins and I think that some kind of completely external mapping would be more realistic for those plugins. If I am not mistaken, Buckminster guys already did something like that to map projects to version control systems.

All in all this issue is probably beyond just Mylyn project and it would make sense to hear what other project leads would think of the proposed solution, so it won't go the same path as Mylyn usage monitor vs. EPP monitor.

BTW, for Eclipse projects it might make sense to have some kind of integration with Eclipse portal, though it may require portal to provide mapping from projects/plugin ids to bugzilla components.</thetext>

    <thetext>Eugene: we can take a bit of time on tomorrow's call for any clarification that you need on this.  I have described our solution at the last Architecture Council meeting to a positive response, and when we are ready we will be proceeding with informing the Foundation and/or project leads on how to contribute the necessary mappings.</thetext>

    <thetext>I would like to change the current extension point to have a more explicit notion of products and organizations. Instead of using pluginRepository mappings as an entry point I would like to propose the following change:

pre. 
&lt;extension point="org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.bugs.support"&gt;
&lt;category
  id="org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.bugs.openSource"
  name="Open-Source"
  description="Community supported Open-Source projects"/&gt;
&lt;organization
  id="org.eclipse"
  name="Eclipse.org"
  description="Eclipse Open-Source projects"
  icon="icons/32/eclipse.png"/&gt;
&lt;product
  id="org.eclipse.mylyn"
  name="Mylyn"
  description="Task Management and Task-Focused Interface"
  pluginId="org.eclipse.mylyn" (for branding icon, installed version) /&gt;
&lt;productRepositoryMapping
  namespace="org.eclipse.mylyn"
  productId="org.eclipse.mylyn"
  &lt;repository
    kind="bugzilla"
    url="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs"&gt;
  &lt;/repository&gt;
  &lt;property
    name="product"
    value="Mylyn"&gt;
  &lt;/property&gt;
/&gt;
&lt;productRepositoryMapping
  namespace="org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks"
  productId="org.eclipse.mylyn"
  &lt;property
    name="component"
    value="Tasks"&gt;
  &lt;/property&gt;
&lt;/product&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;

The main driver for this is that different vendors may offer support for the same product and hence need different mappings. In the UI the user would be presented with a combo box for selecting the "Organization - Product" when reporting a bug from the error log.</thetext>

pre..

		# define category, weight determines ordering
		&lt;category description="Community supported Open-Source projects"

			description="Eclipse Open-Source projects" icon="icons/branding32/eclipse.png"
			id="org.eclipse" name="Eclipse.org" url="http://eclipse.org/" /&gt;
		# default mapping for all org.eclipse.* namespaces
		&lt;mapping namespace="org.eclipse"&gt;
			&lt;repository kind="bugzilla" url="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs"&gt;
			&lt;/repository&gt;
		&lt;/mapping&gt;
		
		# Mylyn: only included if org.eclipse.mylyn plug-in is installed
		&lt;product featureId="org.eclipse.mylyn_feature" id="org.eclipse.mylyn"
			pluginId="org.eclipse.mylyn" providerId="org.eclipse" url="http://eclipse.org/mylyn/" /&gt;
		# generic mapping for bug reporting from error log
		&lt;mapping namespace="org.eclipse.mylyn" productId="org.eclipse.mylyn"&gt;
			&lt;property name="product" value="Mylyn"&gt;
			&lt;/property&gt;
		&lt;/mapping&gt;
		# more specific mappings for errors logged by tasks framework
		&lt;mapping namespace="org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks" productId="org.eclipse.mylyn"&gt;
			&lt;property name="component" value="Tasks"&gt;
			&lt;/property&gt;
		&lt;/mapping&gt;
		
		# PDE: all branding is picked up from org.eclipse.pde feature
		&lt;product featureId="org.eclipse.pde" id="org.eclipse.pde"
			providerId="org.eclipse" /&gt;
		&lt;mapping namespace="org.eclipse.pde" productId="org.eclipse.pde"&gt;
			&lt;property name="product" value="PDE"&gt;

    <thetext>We have numerous bugs that are related to the fact that local tasks have a completely separate editor.  We should merge these into a single editor facility, while still ensuring that we support a clear UI differentiation between what's shared and what's local/private information.</thetext>

    <thetext>I have added a new class RichTextEditor which encapsulates all spell checking and WikiText support without requiring a TaskDataModel. Shawn, you might want to use that for the notes. Feel free to make changes to the class as necessary. Note that you need to invoke CommonTextSupport.install(editor.getViewer(), true) to make content assist key-bindings work.</thetext>

    <thetext>I have committed the start to these changes.  What I have done is merged the code from the Planning and Notes part into a PersonalPart that can be used for the local task editor and made a facade to it for repository task editors.  With these changes, the planning page is now only used for local tasks and the TaskEditorPersonalPart is contributed to the repository tasks.  Steffen, can you review the changes to AbstractTaskEditorPage and let me know what you think?

Still left to do:
* add spell checking and wikitext support to the notes
* layout tweaks
* create an attributes section for local tasks</thetext>

    <thetext>I have a task connector that would like to use the support extension, but its support requests are not sent to a task repository, but rather a custom web form. It would be good to have a way to support this via the normal error reporting extension instead of doing something custom.</thetext>

    <thetext>I have moved the API that was added to AbstractTaskContributor to a new class named AbstractSupportHandler since the old extension point is now deprecated and the methods are no longer invoked.  

It is now possible to invoke ITaskContribution.setHandled() in AbstractSupportHandler.process() to stop further processing and the creation of a task.  </thetext>

    <thetext>A connector that I am writing performs queries on the child task level and then gets all parents for the tasks to create a heirarchy.  It would be nice if the framework supported this similar to how is supports the subtasks with dependency relationships.</thetext>

    <thetext>It is possible to return parent relationships in AbstractRepositoryConnector.getTaskRelations() by using TaskRelation.parentTask(). These relations are currently ignored by the framework but I am planning to support this in the future. Tentatively scheduling for 3.0.2.</thetext>

    <thetext>This raises an interesting problem: If a connector does not provide parent relationships this patch will actually cause tasks to get removed from their parent. This would break backwards compatibility, e.g. when a sub-task is updated but not it's parent it could cause the task to move unexpectedly. This may require additional API, e.g. supportsTaskRelation(TaskData, TaskRelation.Kind, TaskRelation.Direction).</thetext>

    <thetext>We'll have to reconsider the patch as part of the refactoring for bug 239290. We probably need a more flexible strategy to specify which dependent tasks should be downloaded as part of synchronization.</thetext>

    <thetext>Shawn, can you sanity check these changes? The SynchronizationScheduler now keeps track of the ongoing background synchronizations and only toggles a flag if a synchronization for a  repository or task is requested that is already in progress. Once the synchronization is complete it checks the flag and restarts if necessary to always ensure that the task list is up to date but it will never schedule multiple background synchronizations for the same subject in parallel.

I have also removed a couple of extraneous refreshes of the task list which makes opening of tasks feel a bit faster.</thetext>

    <thetext>Just to be clear: Do you really cancel the old synchronization and then start a new one?
Steffen says "Once the synchronization is complete it checks the flag and restarts..."
This does not sound like cancelling -- or is it implemented in other ways?</thetext>

    <thetext>Currently the old job is completed and then restarted if necessary. It is not cancelled as not all connectors support that properly. We can consider that as an optimization for the future and possibly add a flag to the connector whether that is supported.</thetext>

This addresses one possible model described there.
That issue describes the need to have pluggable models; this issue

(this issue). 

But i'm fine with this being the dupe, i'll watch the other issue.

    <thetext>Some connectors may want to allow to group query results in a
repository-specific way: for example by assignee, by due date, by target
component, target version or other connector-specific attributes. Such grouping
don't really makes much sense at the global Task List level, because these
properties can't be generalized, but they fit quite well for the individual
queries.</thetext>

generic groupby support for TaskListContentProvider

I've tried to introduce new presentation mode for groupping, but it turns out that it make more sense to have generic support for groupping in TaskListContentProvider. This patch adds reuired functionality to the content provider, adds new "group by" menu to the Task List view (by owner, priority, kind, repo, sheduled and due date), code to save and restore grouping mode and restoring upon focusing activation.</thetext>

    <thetext>Eugene: could you consider splitting this into (1) a Sandbox patch that uses a presentation and into a separate (2) patch that just groups the archive by repository?  As you know we need (2) asap and there is no additional UI complexity to work out there.  (1) is tricker, we still don't support deeper nesting properly on all platforms due to custom draw problems, and as you know I want to tread extremely carefully with supporting more nesting.  Also, note that TaskListContentProvider requires a rewrite.</thetext>

    <thetext>Mik, I don't understand your comment about presentation. The patch I've proposed does exactly what original request is asking for. It does work across both existing presentations. Also it does not making nesting deeper... well, almost. It is the same as for subtasks without grouping, so subtasks go one level deeper when grouping is on.

Also, this is quite simple patch that does not change internals of the content provider or the task list presentation. I think for such simplicity added value is very very hight. I finally been able to clean by Archive category and grouping by priority or by the owner is simply priceless (i.e. I immediately found few wrong assignments).</thetext>

    <thetext>To clarify. The change for content provider is quite isolated. The only changed method is:

	public Object[] getChildren(Object parent) {
		return getFilteredChildrenFor(parent).toArray();
	}

and change look like this:

	public Object[] getChildren(Object parent) {
		List&lt;AbstractTaskContainer&gt; children = getFilteredChildrenFor(parent);
		*if ((parent instanceof AbstractRepositoryQuery || parent instanceof TaskArchive) 
				&amp;&amp; view.getGroupBy()!=GroupBy.None) {
			return getGroups((AbstractTaskContainer) parent, children).toArray();
		} else if (parent instanceof TaskGroup) {
			return ((TaskGroup) parent).getChildren().toArray();*
		} else {
			return children.toArray();
		}
	}

	private Collection&lt;TaskGroup&gt; getGroups(AbstractTaskContainer parent, List&lt;AbstractTaskContainer&gt; children) {
		TreeMap&lt;String, TaskGroup&gt; groups = new TreeMap&lt;String, TaskGroup&gt;();

		for (AbstractTaskContainer container : children) {
			if(container instanceof AbstractTask) {
				AbstractTask task = (AbstractTask) container;
				String key = view.getGroupBy().getKey(task);
				if (key == null || key.length() == 0) {
					key = "&lt;unknown&gt;";
				}
				TaskGroup group = groups.get(key);
				if (group == null) {
					group = new TaskGroup(parent.getHandleIdentifier(), key);
					groups.put(key, group);
				}
				group.internalAddChild(task);
			}
		}

		return groups.values();
	}

In result this stuff is working for both Categorized and Scheduled presentations. So, it doesn't seem like moving it into separate presentation would allow us to have same functionality without duplicating code.</thetext>

    <thetext>I realize that this is a small fix with significant potential for value and waaay back we used to support this kind of category nesting/grouping, which we then realized complicated the UI tremendously and have avoided nested containers sine.  Some of the reasoning is related to the accepted tradeffs between hierarchies (e.g. Microsoft Project) and monocline lists (e.g. modern Apple UIs) and leaning towards the latter (for some background as to why see literature such as: http://platypuswiki.sourceforge.net/whatis/inspirational/cooper.html ).  I also added an entry on this to: http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php?title=Mylyn_Focused_UI_Design&amp;action=submit#Avoid_Hierarchies

That said, I definitely do not want to slow down experimentation in this area and there are use cases where hierarchies are useful, which is why this item is scheduled for 3.0.  However, this simple addition needs more UI design because it is so closely related to changes we are planning with bug 170681 and because it overlaps with query creation as discussed on the weekly call.

We created Presentations for the purpose of experimentation, and this can easily be added to a presentation.  To facilitate this I just committed a new method called TaskListView.getPresentations().  To proceed with the general case, please create a Sandbox patch for the presentation that copies the current content provider, something like the following.  As per my comment#12 the related patch that we could take for the core is a grouping of the archive container by repository (bug 152710) which is a priority for 2.1.

	private ITaskListPresentation catagorizedPresentation = new ITaskListPresentation() {

		public IStructuredContentProvider getContentProvider() {
			return new &lt;YourSubtypeOf&gt;TaskListContentProvider(TaskListView.this);
		}

		public String getPresentationName() {
			return "Nested Categorization (Sandobx)";
		}

		public ImageDescriptor getImageDescriptor() {
			return TasksUiImages.CATEGORY;
		}
	};</thetext>

    <thetext>Mik, the change you just made on PresentationDropDownSelectionAction is very very bad idea, so as the static methods in the TaskList class. I should remind you about still unresolved issue that been requesting allowing multiple instances of the Task List view and stuff you've just added directly hurt it.

I am not quite following your logic about presentations. According to your last comment they are experimental feature, then why aren't they in the sandbox, but grouping has to be? Anyways, I am not exactly amused with the idea of using copy/paste stuff, especially for such thing as content provider.</thetext>

&gt; Mik, the change you just made on PresentationDropDownSelectionAction is very
&gt; very bad idea, so as the static methods in the TaskList class. I should remind
&gt; you about still unresolved issue that been requesting allowing multiple
&gt; instances of the Task List view and stuff you've just added directly hurt it.

As indicated on the Javadoc for that method it is temporary and I disagree that it is a bad idea because it is an interim solution on an internal class that makes it easy to add custom presentations and will be trivial to address if we provide multiple instances of the Task List view.  Once we have had a chance to modularize content providers and make ITaskListPresentation API we will support adding presentations via extension point (as mentioned on the corresponding javadoc and comments on TaskListView).

&gt; I am not quite following your logic about presentations. According to your last
&gt; comment they are experimental feature, then why aren't they in the sandbox, but
&gt; grouping has to be? Anyways, I am not exactly amused with the idea of using
&gt; copy/paste stuff, especially for such thing as content provider.

Sorry if I was unclear.  The presentations we have and the mechanism are not experimental, but one of the key reasons that we implemented them is to enable experimentation with different presentations of task list elements.  Regarding copy/pasting the content provider, you should be able to do a good portion of what you want via overriding parts of it and avoid copy/paste that way.  As you know I feel strongly about avoiding copy/paste at all costs, but until we fix up the content provider architecture and fix its modularity this should be the best option.  It will also enable changing the content in a way that's specific to your presentation (e.g. not showing query nodes at all, or merging multiple query nodes into a single one).</thetext>

    <thetext>I see where are you going and I don't like that. In my opinion presentation should only show existing things differently. However grouping is a global property (unless it is done at the query level, which I haven't been suggesting and which would even worse fit into the presentation stuff) and aggregating multiple multiple queries into one is a completely separate story. 

The reason I don't think grouping and aggregating query should be done trough presentations is that they both have additional settings, which will be confusing to have across presentations and also like I mentioned before, it does make sense to group tasks in any presentation. Am I still missing something?

Also note that this report is one of the most voted non-connector related enhancements.</thetext>

    <thetext>Patch reviewed and almost ready to apply.  The appending of the number of children to the label of the parent is non-standard, so I would like to remove it.  Also, is there a good driver for having grouped by Scheduled and Due?  I think that those should be the responsibility of the Scheduled presentation, which needs some improvement.  we can chat more about this on the call.</thetext>

    <thetext>Mik, I am not quite fascinated with what you are doing with this patch. You've made several commits from this patch code under completely unrelated tasks, effectively loosing  and in result lost some of functionality in the label provider class.

Also, you should have brought to the discussion if TaskGroup class should be internal or not (just to pay some respect to the author of the patch). By moving it into the internal package you practically forcing integrators to use internal API if they need to build something around task grouping.</thetext>

    <thetext>Today's commit of this was accidental, I've had it in an outgoing change set all week and got caught by bug 184963.  Will post discussion on patch progress here, since I'm not done with review.  Yup, I know about the omission from the label provider.  Regarding the move of TaskGroup, I'm not ready to make it API yet because of overlap with TaskCategory (final and internal) a variant of which might become API.  Can I get rid of the following methods in TaskGroup?  The first does nothing and the second mixes presentation with the data structure:

	@Override
	public Set&lt;AbstractTask&gt; getChildren() {
		return super.getChildren();
	}

	@Override
	public String getSummary() {
		return summary + " / " + super.getChildren().size();

    <thetext>I am not really concerned about TaskCategory, because it have no meaningful semantics and groups completely random tasks opposed to TaskGroup. You can put a warning that class may change, same way you've done with some methods on the TaskList view.

Ok to remove these methods, but it would be nice to make label provider to show child count for TaskGroup until bug 199345 is fixed, especially because this is a sandbox functionality and it won't appear on the common UI.</thetext>

Most changes are committed now.  I was hoping to have this fully incorporated into the Sandbox today but ran out of time due to the re-implementation required on bug 199342.  These additional presentations will have to be refactored around the new extension point.  Please post here if anything about the new extension point does not meet your needs for this bug.  Also, note that I would like to add an integer-based importance ranking to presentations so that we can keep "Categorized" on top.</thetext>

    <thetext>I've made patch with the refactored presentation, but instead of attaching it to the bug report I accidentally committed it, including change in the TaskElementLabelProvider to show child count for TaskGroup nodes. Feel free to roll back these changes if they don't match your expectations.

I am sorry about the side effects caused by the extension point reader, but the main rationale for using content provider in the extension point instead of abstract presentation, was to eliminate need in implementing presentation class, which is really redundant. Also, with the current abstract class presentation is also not pretty because in some cases presentation id is not known up front. Id should be set from the extension point instead of hardcoding it in the presentation contructor. 

Ok for adding integer ranking.</thetext>

    <thetext>Patches revised, made the following changes:
* Added the boolean notion of whether a presentation is primary (see extension point doc).  I think that this is more clear in the UI than a priority based sorting, since it just causes a separator to be added.  
* Changed the icon for the new presentations to disambiguate them and added "(Experimental)".
* Removed the scheduled and due presentations for now, since they overlap with the Scheduled presentations and I think we should iterate on the existing 3 before adding more.

My main question now is why these presentations are grouped by category/query?  I'm still not clear on the use cases for all the presentations, but for one like "by Owner" I see more benefit in excluding the query nesting than including it.  For the "by Repository" one the nesting does not make sense for query nodes, but I guess it could make sense for categories?  Have you considered removing the category/query nesting?</thetext>

&gt; point doc).  I think that this is more clear in the UI than a priority based
&gt; sorting, since it just causes a separator to be added.  

great idea

&gt; * Changed the icon for the new presentations to disambiguate them and added
&gt; "(Experimental)".

there is already standard icon for groups in Eclipse - 3 colored bars, I think it is used in a few places, including help UI, but I couldn't find its source

&gt; * Removed the scheduled and due presentations for now, since they overlap with
&gt; the Scheduled presentations and I think we should iterate on the existing 3
&gt; before adding more.

Like I've been saying before, existing presentations don't give "scheduled" slicing per query/category and there is no presentation that shows "due" date. This is extremely useful with connectors that do support "due" on the server side (like JIRA does)

&gt; My main question now is why these presentations are grouped by category/query? 

Because it does give useful context, especially for those who are working or monitoring more then one project at a time. Those projects could actually have same developers and it doesn't make sense to group them across the projects.

Also note that with this stuff enabled some of the "recommended" queries doesn't make sense anymore (i.e. one-query-per-developer thing) because much easier setup is available (one query per project + grouping by owner).

&gt; I'm still not clear on the use cases for all the presentations, but for one
&gt; like "by Owner" I see more benefit in excluding the query nesting than
&gt; including it.  For the "by Repository" one the nesting does not make sense for
&gt; query nodes, but I guess it could make sense for categories?  Have you
&gt; considered removing the category/query nesting?

I really don't like idea of any special rules or exceptions for those things. 
Also, there is also queries that work across repositories. See bug 195047 (which is btw waiting on your feedback)</thetext>

    <thetext> (In reply to comment #39)
&gt; Almost forgot. Can you please move TaskGroup back out of the internal packages.

TaskGroup is not ready to be API yet, because we have to consider the overlap with TaskCategory as previously discussed.  When applying the patch I added an entry on this to: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn_Porting_Guide  Please feel free to add a bug for making TaskGroup (or a variant) API if you would like to see one of these be public in the first part of the 3.0 cycle.

&gt; BTW, it is minor, but there is no point to keep separate collections for
&gt; presentations. It is rather confusing to split their elements this way (kind of
&gt; mixing data and presentation of the presentation drop down).

Yup, had the same thought.  But it's internals that need refactoring anyway, and the (internal) API doesn't expose the fact that there are two collections.

&gt; there is already standard icon for groups in Eclipse - 3 colored bars, 
&gt; I think it is used in a few places, including help UI, but I couldn't find its source

I belive the meaning of that icon is along the lines of category/tag/categories/label.

Regarding your other points on comment#38, I think that we need to have a design discussion about the next direction for this.  For example, I've always seen considerable benefit to the notion that you simply point your query at a project and then you see all tasks grouped by each person on that project.  But that's only one point in the design space of how the UI should encourage certain queries and groupings, while remaining flexible enough for expert usage.  I've added an item to the agenda for the next conference call.</thetext>

True. Though those groups are sort of categories and they will make even more sense when/if we'll have some drag and drop support between groups.

&gt; Mik, this is really tiring and simply ridiculous. We are talking about sandbox
&gt; features here. Why don't you just drop it into the sandbox and then discuss it
&gt; for as long as you like?

I am working with the premise that the goal was to get this out of the Sandbox, and instead of having a dump of every property that we have drive a grouping focus on identifying some use cases and improving the UI so that we can get enough feedback on this to improve it and make it part of the distribution.  If that's not the goal let me know and I won't invest more time in fixing the overhead that you are creating by providing rushed patches, without a clear UI design or discussion, that sometimes break existing functionality (e.g. presentations regression), never include tests, and introduce new API without considering or discussing implications.

Since I still see promise in this functionality, and am still trying not to get too annoyed by your trying to push it through without due consideration, so I have enabled all but the "by Due date" groupings that you have provided.  If anyone would like to be able to work with their Task List grouped per query and per due date please post and we can enable that too.  

I am trying to experiment with using the presentations for my own work and finding the result considerably too noisy (i.e. too much category-looking nesting for the benefit).  I've committed a change to the grouping node to look different from the category node to see if that helps.   We can iterate on the icon later but this one has the benefit of being visually quiet.</thetext>

&gt; focus on identifying some use cases and improving the UI so that we can get
&gt; enough feedback on this to improve it and make it part of the distribution.

My interpretation of sandbox and "unsupported" feature is to allow users to try it first and capture feedback, but we won't be able to capture any feedback for something that is not possible to try. Besides, you don't have to move all grouping modes/presentations at once and can do it one by one.
  
&gt; If that's not the goal let me know and I won't invest more time in fixing the
&gt; overhead that you are creating by providing rushed patches, without a clear UI
&gt; design or discussion, that sometimes break existing functionality (e.g.
&gt; presentations regression), 

Well, someone have to do work while others are talking. This issue is created more then half a year ago and my contribution don't even cover the initially requested features. As you know I am trying to do stuff incrementally and introduced minor regression slipped trough your own code review process.

&gt; never include tests, and introduce new API without
&gt; considering or discussing implications.

That is simply NOT true. I do include tests in some cases and constantly including related discussion topics on every other weekly meeting. It is nowhere my fault that this stuff is being pushed back and I am getting all kind of resistance for those new features.

On the other hand, I remember numerous examples when you yourself been changing or removing major features without discussing them with the rest of the team. Maybe I am just taking your example...

&gt; Since I still see promise in this functionality, and am still trying not to get
&gt; too annoyed by your trying to push it through without due consideration, 

Are you saying that I should be thankful?

&gt; so I have enabled all but the "by Due date" groupings that you have provided.  
&gt; If anyone would like to be able to work with their Task List grouped per 
&gt; query and per due date please post and we can enable that too.

Actually you've disabled grouping by scheduled date too. I disagree with that, but can understand this, because there is a close overlap with Scheduled presentation (which I can't get used because it don't have required context). However, I don't understand why did you disabled "due date" grouping which is not available trough any other presentation, but it is very important visualization very useful for planning.

Anyways, I wonder what is your idea how anyone would know that there is a feature like that, so whey will be able to try it before they can give any feedback? 
 
&gt; I am trying to experiment with using the presentations for my own work and
&gt; finding the result considerably too noisy (i.e. too much category-looking
&gt; nesting for the benefit).  I've committed a change to the grouping node to look
&gt; different from the category node to see if that helps.   We can iterate on the
&gt; icon later but this one has the benefit of being visually quiet.

I don't see that in CVS. Though those presentations meant to serve purpose of the bug triaging and planning and should nicely complement multiple task list instances to facilitate analysis and support drag and drop features.</thetext>

The new icon is less noisy but it the old icon gave the task list a more unified look: All categories had a folder icon vs. tasks that have a file like icon. I need to use this more to get a better a feeling what I prefer.

Did you also remove the information about the number of tasks in each category? I found that incredibly helpful to get an idea of the load each person has for a particular release (I have a query for each milestone). Maybe we could make that decoration a configurable option for now?

&gt; I found that incredibly helpful to get an idea of the load each person has for a
&gt; particular release (I have a query for each milestone). Maybe we could make that
&gt; decoration a configurable option for now?

There is a bug 199345 for that and I though we agreed to keep number of elements on the group nodes until bug 199345 is resolved.</thetext>

I assume you mean the folder icon used by categories?  I mentioned the problems with that (groupings != categories) but I can put it back if you guys prefer it, since this is all experimental.

What I said is that the number of nodes should not be returned as the label of the model element.  If you want to append it create a Platform decorator for the category groupings and add that to the Sandbox.

I tried using various groupings for a week but found that they typically added additional nodes without being sufficiently useful (e.g. often very few children under a node right under a query) so I'm back to categories.  Is anyone working regularly in this mode?  If so could you please describe how you're using it (e.g. which grouping, in Focused mode or not).</thetext>

suggested icon

(In reply to comment #46)
&gt; I assume you mean the folder icon used by categories?  I mentioned the problems
&gt; with that (groupings != categories) but I can put it back if you guys prefer
&gt; it, since this is all experimental.

Here is icon I am suggesting for group nodes

&gt; What I said is that the number of nodes should not be returned as the label of
&gt; the model element.  If you want to append it create a Platform decorator for
&gt; the category groupings and add that to the Sandbox.

It wasn't coded in the model, but label been constructed by hardcoded implementation in the label provider, which been recently removed.

&gt; I tried using various groupings for a week but found that they typically added
&gt; additional nodes without being sufficiently useful (e.g. often very few
&gt; children under a node right under a query) so I'm back to categories.  Is
&gt; anyone working regularly in this mode?  If so could you please describe how
&gt; you're using it (e.g. which grouping, in Focused mode or not).

I am not using these grouping all the time, but find it quite useful when planning and triaging. Also, to narrow down task list context I often use "go into" and that helps with nesting as well as with quick search.</thetext>

    <thetext>That icon is intended to mean category which isn't perfect, but the current icon is pretty clearly worse because it means presentation.  RSSOwl does or did make similar use of the category icon (though maybe for tagging) and I found it reasonable when I used to use it there.  What's good about that icon is that it is nice looking and relatively meaningless, which is helpful because it corresponds to different kind of objects.  Applied.</thetext>

    <thetext>Because the UI implications for the Task List are so significant, and because some of the use cases are more about queries for the purpose of planning than about reorganizing the Task List, here's how I propose we proceed.  Instead of adding these presentations into the Task List right now, we make each of the Groupings that are currently added by the Sandbox (other than Incoming) work for the Search view.  This will both provide a useful feature (e.g. query all Mylyn 2.2 bugs and view by owner) and it will give us a way of experimenting further with groupings.  I think that we could make groupings available as part of Search for Mylyn 2.2, as long as the additional groupings do not show up in the Task List for 2.2.  Once that's done, and we all have some usage mileage on that, it should give us enough information to figure out the split between Task List and Presentations and planning/search/groupings in order to figure out the best combination of UI for 3.0.

    <thetext>While grouping in Search view could be useful, it is much less useful then grouping in the Task List. Also note that challenges with implementing grouping in the Task List won't be the same as for the Search view, so as the actual use cases and the whole purpose for grouping is different.</thetext>

    <thetext>Good point, the use cases are different.  However, for reasons mentioned at the end of comment#52 I think that this is important to try.  In general I find that Mylyn does not make good enough use of the Search view for showing the user a useful representation of a temporary query for activities such as planning.  While the Search view is static and requires a button push to refresh results, it is still a pretty good UI to be used for this purpose.  For example, I do almost all the Mylyn planning with it, because I don't want to pollute my Task List with too much temporary planning info.  In order to get more insight on the split between the Task List view UI and the Search UI, and then unblock progress on this bug. I have created bug 209407.</thetext>

    <thetext>That is the strangest thing. By using Search view you are just working around the grouping limitations of the Task List view. Also, like I mentioned before, "refresh" on Search view results is quite useless because it doesn't allow to tweak query criteria (you can only create new search, but not edit the existing one)</thetext>

    <thetext>What gave you the impression that the project vision is changing?  I wonder if I have miscommunicated something, but as far as I can tell all of my comments on this bug are in line with what I tried to communicate to you on the call.  Since there seems to be some misunderstanding of the vision and/or scope of the project, let me know what that is as I would like to document it on the wiki and solicit feedback.  

Maybe the problem is that we have not been expicit enough about how planning tools overlap with the scope of Mylyn?  But at every opportunity we have indiciated that we cannot take on fancy planning facilities, or turn the Task List into a planning tool, without a significant increase in the resources on the project. </thetext>

    <thetext>Mik, my point is that advanced grouping and tagging features are property not only planning tool, those kind of things help awareness on the project and facilitate team collaboration (for example I found dozen stale issues using special grouping modes in the task list). 

Initially you were open about adding grouping features to the task list, but lately that been changed, that is what I call change in the project vision. Also, I am not sure how task-related project can get away without supporting planning features, unless they been reserved for commercial products, but that will be very sad for the whole community.</thetext>

    <thetext> (In reply to comment #58)
&gt; Initially you were open about adding grouping features to the task list, but
&gt; lately that been changed, that is what I call change in the project vision.

Eugene: I proposed that we experiment with these features, and we have put substantial cycles into experimenting with them, and there is still some promise to integrate some of these ideas, and this bug is still scheduled for 3.0.  I appreciate that you blogged about this in order to get votes on it.  However, unfortunately you and I have not converged in how we can add this feature to Mylyn in a way that is both usable and something that's within the project's ability to support.   

&gt; Also, I am not sure how task-related project can get away without supporting
&gt; planning features, unless they been reserved for commercial products, but that
&gt; will be very sad for the whole community.

Planning features beyond the Task List's facilities have never been in scope for the project.  We experimented with the Task Activity view, and incorporated this schedule-based point of view into the Task List, but it is clear that we do not have the resources to support full on planning tools beyond the basic personal planning that the Task List is intended for.  

You have made similar criticisms on other bug reports as well and for the non-technical parts bugs are not the right place for them.  You are definitely free to share your opinion with others, in case there are others in the community who feel the same way, and should consider sending a complaint to the mylyn-dev mailing list that you don't agree with the scope or vision of the project, or with that you don't agree with how Tasktop committers prioritize addressing the communities' needs, or what your other ideas are for drawing additional resources to the project to support your particular priorities.</thetext>

    <thetext>If it's too hard to add used defined depth grouping, could you add a fixed size (==1) grouping on 1 field only? It would be better than categories, since it would be "dynamic".

I'd love to see a "Group by" menu with target milestone, version, assigned, etc items. Right now i have to modify my queries or make a lot of them.</thetext>

    <thetext>First steps for generalizing the Task Repositories view:

    <thetext>What if we add a *category* element to the org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.ui.repositories extension point. We could then add *category* as an additional attribute on *connectorCore* elements.  The TaskRepository view would then present all contributed Categories in a tree view. TaskRepositories have a connector kind, Connectors have categories. Thoughts?</thetext>

    <thetext>I thought the point of the categorized list was to avoid hierarchies at least as long the view is a configuration UI and does not allow interacting with repositories (e.g. browsing of artifacts).

&gt; I thought the point of the categorized list was to avoid hierarchies at least as
&gt; long the view is a configuration UI and does not allow interacting with
&gt; repositories (e.g. browsing of artifacts).

My thinking was that new categories would always be top level nodes with only repositories as the children.
 
&gt; If categories are defined through the extension point that would allow
&gt; connectors to define custom categories. Do we want that?
Good question. There could be existing Mylyn categories (Tasks, Bugs, Other) that extenders would usually set as the category but could also declare others. This could lead confusion if everybody thinks they need their won category though.  Perhaps Tasks, Bugs, Other should just be THE options on the extension point.</thetext>

    <thetext>That looks good.  I guess the open question is how do repositories get categorized?  I wonder if there should be a standard set of categories in Mylyn (i.e. tasks, bugs, reviews, builds, scm, etc) that connectors can specify what category(ies) they should/could be in.  I would assume that task repository can't be a build repository, meaning that a user should have to choose from task or bug repository.  Maybe there should be a check if it can query and can create task to determine if the user should make a selection or not?</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks for the screenshot. Does the indentation come from using a tree?

Do you see a need to implement specific behavior for categories (repository kinds)? I was thinking of categories as a simple attribute on a repository hence it seems overkill to me to extend AbstractRepositoryKind. Why not use a concrete class and create three instances with different properties (similar to an enum)? Why does AbstractRepositoryKind implement IRepositoryElement?</thetext>

I was imagining a category property on TaskRepository objects. I would be careful with calling this kind since kind is already used in various contexts and repository kind vs. connector kind can get very confusing particularly since there are still legacy classes that inconsistently use repository kind.

I would keep the behavior and configuration separate from this. We already have API for determining capabilities and we should consider extending that if capabilities are missing.</thetext>

'Category' works for me. So it sounds like connector extensions should declare which of a set of pre-defined categories their repositories should be a part of?

The indent is likely due to it being a tree, I'll see if it can be avoided.</thetext>

&gt; which of a set of pre-defined categories their repositories should be a part of?

I don't think this will require any new API since connectors already manage creation of repositories in the settings page. I was just saying that I would not enable/disable any UI elements based on the categorization but use the existing can...(), supports...() methods on the connector classes to control that.</thetext>

&gt; Shawn's comment does raise an important point though in regard to repository
&gt; presentation in wizards for instance. There is a question whether users should
&gt; be able to filter by category or if categories should be shown in those views as
&gt; well.

I think that filtering by category should be allowed (and could be done automatically if a user says add a repository from a category).  It would probably make some sense to have the categorization in the new* wizards as well since it would help users to find what repository they are looking for.</thetext>

Incremental improvements.  New Task wizard has category decorations.  Would be nice to be able to categorize the connector selection page as well but connectors would need to have a category assigned.  Just noticed that this patch removes some of the NON-NLS tags, will need to fix this in next patch.</thetext>

    <thetext>Rob: Can you proceed with this?  Looks like what you're missing is the proper indentation, like we have in the Task List?  Please use the Task List style for now (indented, with icons) and we can consider improving on that post Helios, eg, with an iTunes style of bold sections, extra spacing, and no icons.</thetext>

    <thetext>Points from UI review:
* Will need to take heuristic approach to categorizing existing repositories and those added via extension point (i.e. check for support extension usage)
* Category should likely be applied in the Task Repositories view and may need a combo (i.e. a setNeedsCategorization(boolean) method as per usual,if we allow users to adjust categories)</thetext>

Includes repositoryMigrator extension. Connectors need to implement AbstractRepositoryMigrator to move their respective repositories to Tasks or Bugs, otherwise they're collected under 'Other'.  BugzillaRepositoryMigrator and LocalRepositoryMigrator serve as examples.</thetext>

    <thetext>Some suggestions:

* Please add API documentation for AbstractRepositoryMigrator and set the copyright header to 2010.
* Add categories for Build and Review and don't show empty categories.
* I can select a repository category when creating a new query (the Next button should probably be disabled in that case)

I have a concern that it is too late to rename the view considering that this affects almost all documentation such as user guides, FAQs etc. including documentation maintained by integrators.

My initial impression was that this change does not provide any value at the moment since there are very few categories and I can't change categorization manually.  It would be nice if I could group less frequently used repositories in a category and have that node collapsed by default for instance.</thetext>

    <thetext>If you have a query with unread hits, toogle to "Focus on Workweek" mode, mark the query
as read, the hits disappear, but the query folder not.

You have to disable/enable the

    <thetext>Another refresh problem is that if a query is hidden in "Focus on Workweek" mode and an incomming comes in, it is not displayed until "Focus on Workweek" is toggled.  Both issues here are also manifested in any category/query using scheduling:

To reproduce:
Create a category and put 1 task scheduled for this week in it.  Schedule it for next week and the task will disappear, but the category will stay.  Now toggle the filter and it will disappear.  Now schedule it for today.  The filter will need to be toggled to show the task.</thetext>

    <thetext>The container will now be guaranteed to disappear after the next query successfully completes.  We still have this particular problem however, because we do not refresh the root of the Task List after the contents of a task change.  To do that without triggering too much refresh we will have to do another revamp of our refresh policy and ensure that each task has all of it's parents mapped.  The easiest way to reproduce this is:
* In focused mode, have a single task scheduled in a category
* Unschedule it, category won't disappear
* Same thing will happen with the task not showing when scheduled</thetext>

&gt; Same with marking single task or query hit read/unread

Yes, that's the description/summary of the bug.  Any change to the task that's related to its visibility will have the same effect.  For the 2.1 release this will be slightly less problematic because the root of the Task List will be refreshed once each query completes (comment#5).</thetext>

&gt; Yes, that's the description/summary of the bug.  

Just to clarify, description seem to talk about marking read a query node, and my comment was about marking task read.</thetext>

    <thetext>Build ID: M20080911-1700

Steps To Reproduce:
The contents of the Cheat Sheet for 'Tasks -&gt; Create a task repository query' do not match the GUI:

Begin the Cheat sheet for 'Create a task repository query'.

1. Under 'Open the Task List view', it states the following:

"If the Task List view is not opened, select in the main menu Window -&gt; Show View -&gt; Task List or click on the 'Click to Perform' link below."

If you click on 'Click to perform' it brings up the correct dialog. But if you follow the instructions and select 'Window -&gt; Show View', there is no 'Task List'
option (it is under the 'Other... -&gt; Mylyn' category). 

2. The next step is 'Setup Task Repository'.  This instructs the user to "select
in the main menu Window &gt; Show View &gt; Other... &gt; Mylyn &gt; Task Repositry".

Notice that the last word, 'Repositry' is misspelled.

    <thetext>Frank: The content that we are going to show is a bit tricky and we need to have more design discussions.  What would be great is if you could contribute a quick outline view that includes the current outline contents, and then we can later figure out how to improve what content goes there.  You can wire this to Ctrl+O for now, and then we can figure out how to add a visible button/link to pop it up later.  After you have the outline working, you could add a node for Subtasks, etc, or suggest other improvements that you would like to see.  Are you interested in doing this for Mylyn 3.4?  Would be a great feature to have for that, but we would need to wrap it up within the next 3 weeks.</thetext>

    <thetext>This looks like a really good start. I am a bit concerned that the flexibility provided by the common navigator is not really needed in this case but a simple tree viewer as it is used by the outline view would suffice. I apologize if comment 10 was misleading in that regard. I meant that as an example how to implement a popup with an embedded tree viewer but not necessarily as a template for the actual viewer. 

I think it would be nice if the viewer code could be shared with the outline including the icons and hierarchy but show additional nodes for attributes, linked tasks etc.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks. I have taken another pass at this and done a few simplifications. The common viewer approach that you took is powerful in terms of extensibility but I want to avoid the extra complexity and the dependency on o.e.ui.navigator so I replaced the common navigator with a tree viewer. It's an interesting idea to display the entire attribute structure in the quick outline but that makes it a rather advanced introspection feature whereas for the first pass I would prefer to focus on providing quick navigation capabilities targeted at intermediate users.

The patch is still incomplete: 
* Presentation of related tasks and navigation to related tasks needs to be improved.
* Navigation to standard attributes is not yet working.

Still open. Should we create an icon for every attribute?

    <thetext>Notes are currently stored in the task list and kept in memory. This has performance implications if the large amounts of text are kept in the notes. It would beneficial to store notes in a separate file on disk and load it on demand (i.e. when the task editor is opened).</thetext>

    <thetext>Removed getNotes() and setNotes() from ITask. 

Mylyn currently supports using notes in the commit comment which now requires team.ui to use tasks.core internals. I am not sure if that support makes sense or if that feature can be removed?</thetext>

    <thetext> (In reply to comment #1)
&gt; Removed getNotes() and setNotes() from ITask.

Is notes still saved in task list xml and backed up as before? It would be really shame to lose all the notes that been created on various tasks.</thetext>

    <thetext>Yes, notes are still saved in the task list. The only thing that has changed is that the API for accessing notes has been removed.</thetext>

    <thetext>Many bugs currently concern issues with children, potential cyclic children, recursing through offspring or other things to do with counting and testing children.	 I ahve extended the Mylyn PropertySources in the sandbox developer tools with three extra bits of information:
- Total children, giving the result of getChildrenInternal(),
- Total offspring, giving the total of unique tasks below the selection,
- Test contains cyclic, return true if any of the offspring contains a cycle</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks Maarten. I have applied the patch with minor modifications: I removed empty comments and JavaDoc tags (e.g. @param adaptableObject) and formatted the source code using our formatting rules. It would be great if you could run that on each file (Edit -&gt; Format) before submitting patches. Other than reformatting I renamed AbstractMylynPropertySource to AbstractTaskContainerPropertySource to reflect its purpose and removed an unused constructor.

I was wondering if we still need the Repository Spy view or if the same information is available from the properties view now?</thetext>

I have the mylyn formatter rulse imported in my mylyn workspace, so that should be no problem
I'll make it an aut save action. 
Hmm, the auto-save action can not be shared through import/export, but are settable on a project basis.
&gt; I was wondering if we still need the Repository Spy view or if the same
&gt; information is available from the properties view now?
Properties are (1) read only and (2) only visible when the object is selected
The view always visible and allows you to delete individual properties, so they revert to their defaults. 
I was thinking of making them all editable and adding a little search button so you can enter the property name and the tree will shrink.
Lets get feedback from connector developers before removing again...</thetext>

&gt; Also not sure about use cases for seeing the spy view all the time
Spy view is used by developers when working on a connector, like I did with bug 207498.
Its in dev tools sandbox so not expected to be visible all the time.</thetext>

    <thetext>I am not so much concerned about having additional views contributed by the sandbox but I would like to avoid having two separate UIs for the same functionality and duplicated code that needs to be maintained. 

 (In reply to comment #6)
&gt; I have the mylyn formatter rulse imported in my mylyn workspace, so that should
&gt; be no problem
&gt; I'll make it an aut save action.

The Mylyn Java formatting rules should be enabled for each Mylyn project. Please let me know if that is not the case. I am in favor of enabling automatic formatting on save which is discussed on bug 210040.

&gt; &gt; I was wondering if we still need the Repository Spy view or if the same
&gt; &gt; information is available from the properties view now?
&gt; Properties are (1) read only and (2) only visible when the object is selected
&gt; The view always visible and allows you to delete individual properties, so they
&gt; revert to their defaults.

Would it be possible to make them editable/deletable from the property view? I am not sure if (2) is important enough since it easy to select the object in the repository view. Do you have a special use case in mind where you require the properties be visible all the time?

Marking resolved as the functionality requested in this bug has been implemented.</thetext>

    <thetext>That would be a nice addition, even if it the task data was only dumped to the console or displayed as text. The attributes can be obtained using this call:

Contribution

I've developed this plugin for the CDO/Net4j project. It creates task comments like:

Committed revision 6916:
- trunk/org.eclipse.emf.cdo.ui
- trunk/org.eclipse.emf.cdo
- deprecated/develop

Where the revision number is recognized as a hyperlink to the History view.

Known issues:

1) There's not enough information in the hyperlink to open the History view on the right SVN repository. Hence org.eclipse.net4j.tools.svn.mylyn.RevisionHyperlink.URL is hardcoded.
2) The revision range is reflectively injected into the HistoryPage. Manual refresh is needed to make it effective.
3) There is no commit comment-&gt;task association. All commits add comments to the *active* task.
4) org.eclipse.net4j.tools.svn.mylyn.MylynCommitHandler.autoSubmit is always ON. In fact the task editor behaves strange if submit is not triggered. Submit seems to need internal Mylyn API.

There are probably more but for us it seems to work. Feedback is welcome ;-)

I'm the only author (exception in org.eclipse.net4j.tools.svn.mylyn.StringHyperlinkDetector explicitely mentioned) and I apply the EPL to this contribution.</thetext>

    <thetext>Note that in terms of Git such a hook needs to be an "after-push-to-origin" hook. Maybe the Git integration needs to be really configurable. For example, when I push to my public GitHub fork, I may just want a comment on the bug. But when I push to the Eclipse.org Git repo then I may want to bug to be transition to a new state (eg. RESOLVED).</thetext>

    <thetext>I found out that you added org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.bugs.support extension point which allows to integrate with bug reporting (bug 212209 comment 36); and it looks good. We (Subversive) also want to integrate with it, e.g. it already includes CVS etc., but this extension point is internal which means that its usage is discouraged.
When will this extension point become public? I didn't investigate too deep but does it allow to include run-time information in description?

    <thetext>I have committed the patch which renames org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.provisional.tasks.bugs to org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.bugs. This has the following implications:

Clients that were previously extending org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.provisional.tasks.bugs.AbstractSupportHandler will need to be modified accordingly and recompiled to extend classes in the new namespace.

The change does not affect clients that were declaring support extensions through XML using the support extension point. The schema is unaltered but not marked internal any longer. 

The deprecated pluginRepositoryMappings and taskContributors extension points have been removed. The extensions were not actually used by the error reporting any longer.</thetext>

    <thetext>Is there any documentation related to the extension point "org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.bugs.support" available?
Actually, there is no schema file in the plug-in and even Google can't propose anything useful.
So, I don't know how much information I can provide using this extension point and how.
Could you please provide some information regarding this extension point?
Or is it possible that I haven't looked good enough? :)

P.S.

    <thetext>Oh, sorry, another question on my side.
I have checked interface ISupportRequest and found this:

Noimplement:
    This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.

"No implement" is all right, but still is there any way to provide important information which cannot be specified through plugin.xml (in Subversive case it is Subversive Connectors version)?</thetext>

    <thetext>The recommended way to provide custom information it is to extends AbstractSupportHandler and to override preProcess(). If you want to add text to the standard blurb provided by DefaultSupportHandler you can use something like this:

SupportHandler extends AbstractSupportHandler {

	@Override
	public void preProcess(ISupportRequest request) {
		ITaskContribution contribution = request.getDefaultContribution();
	    contribution.appendToDescription("My additional information");
	}

}

Otherwise you can implement process() and use contribution.setAttribute(IRepositoryConstants.DESCRIPTION, "My information") to force a description.</thetext>

    <thetext>(In reply to comment #12)
&gt; The recommended way to provide custom information it is to extends
&gt; AbstractSupportHandler and to override preProcess(). If you want to add text to
&gt; the standard blurb provided by DefaultSupportHandler you can use something like
&gt; this:
&gt; 
&gt; SupportHandler extends AbstractSupportHandler {
&gt; 
&gt;     @Override
&gt;     public void preProcess(ISupportRequest request) {
&gt;         ITaskContribution contribution = request.getDefaultContribution();
&gt;         contribution.appendToDescription("My additional information");
&gt;     }
&gt; 
&gt; }
Unfortunately it does not work this way in some cases.

When it works:
1) Help-&gt;Report Bug or Enhancement
2) Error Log-&gt; Right Mouse over log entry -&gt; Report as Bug -&gt; Select repository -&gt;...

When it does not work:
1) Error Log-&gt; Right Mouse over log entry -&gt; Report as Bug -&gt; Report to: Eclipse.org - Subversive SVN Team....
In last case everything set in preProcess() become completely ignored.

&gt; Otherwise you can implement process() and use
&gt; contribution.setAttribute(IRepositoryConstants.DESCRIPTION, "My information")
&gt; to force a description.
This method is probably useless because there seems no way to obtain stack trace from the Mylyn status through the public API.
And even if I call contribution.appendToDescription("My additional information") in process() method context, I still get Mylyn's description overwritten which is slightly contradicting to the method name semantics.

Or maybe I'm missing something again?

P.S.
I have installed Mylyn version 3.4.2.v20100916-0100-e3x-7Z7f77FBBoPbPQeUoFeZXJ8</thetext>

    <thetext>We need to improve user experience by eliminating the possibility of blank/empty views. Another scenario that needs to be eliminated is when focus is applied to the task list when no tasks are scheduled.  We should consider rendering some form of help within the task list view explaining or helping the user in the the right direction.</thetext>

    <thetext>I was opening several bugs in succession and got this.  Not sure of priority so marking P1 for now.

    <thetext>The UI thread was interrupted while waiting for the task list lock. I can reproduce this in the debugger when setting a break point in TaskList.lock() and opening an editor:

Thread [Worker-8] (Suspended (breakpoint at line 841 in Thread))	
	Thread.interrupt() line: 841	
	UILockListener.interruptUI() line: 166	
	UISynchronizer.syncExec(Runnable) line: 166	
	Display.syncExec(Runnable) line: 4018	
	ActivityContextManager.getStructureHandle() line: 224	
	ActivityContextManager.addMonitoredActivityTime(long, long) line: 107	
	ActivityContextManager.access$10(ActivityContextManager, long, long) line: 103	
	ActivityContextManager$CheckActivityJob.run(IProgressMonitor) line: 193	
	Worker.run() line: 55	

How frequently is addMonitoredActivityTime() invoked? I am not sure that it's a good idea to use Display.syncExec(). The active working set could be tracked with a listener for instance and stored in a field on the class.</thetext>

We either need to throw this as a core exception (as in the patch) or simply ignore all together. This patch throws the core exception with CANCEL status.</thetext>

    <thetext>I have committed the attached work-around. Fixing the underlying problem would require moving all code that runs on the UI thread and acquires task list locks to run on separate threads to avoid interruptions. That is a large refactoring and out of the scope of the current milestone.</thetext>

    <thetext>Shawn mentioned that search is also coupled to ui.ide. AbstractRepositoryQueryPage which is a tasks.ui API type currently extends ISearchPage which couples tasks.ui to ui.ide. The dependency is not strictly necessary but decoupling will take a little bit of work: bug 230153 . </thetext>

    <thetext>(In reply to comment #7)
&gt; This is currently not feasible without a major refactoring. 

I just took a look at this and it doesn't seems pretty straightforward to implement:
# Create a org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.ide plug-in to capture our dependencies to org.eclipse.ui.ide.  It may not be the ideal split due to the fact that Platform has put too much itno that plug-in, but it makes sense to follow the architecture of Platform and doesn't limit us.
# Move the OpenTaskAttachmentInDefaultEditorHandler to ..mylyn.tasks.ide
# Make the workspace selection for file attachments a contribution to the "Attach..." wizard's first page and move that into ..mylyn.tasks.ide.

I've added a story where we can discuss the driver for this, and tentatively scheduled it.

    <thetext>Today I switched to heilos as target platform for my application. I noticed that there has not been done a lot about this issue, so I thought I post my investigations about this issue:


I'm working on a client/server application and I'm using mylyn to handle
my own Workflow Tasks.
The application works with a database and no local resources.

Before adding the mylyn plug-ins and their required dependencies I had 100
plug-ins in my Launch Configuration, afterwards the Configuration ended up
with 128 plug-ins.
Which would be ok but some of the plug-ins contribute Menu/Toolbar items,
preference pages and so on. After analyzing the dependencies I found a
point to which I think is a discussion worth.

First here what I found out:

My application requires:

org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.ui
org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.core
org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.ui

Those plug-ins require:

org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.core
org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.net
org.eclipse.mylyn.context.core
org.eclipse.mylyn.monitor.core
org.eclipse.mylyn.monitor.ui

After adding all required plug-ins (without org.eclipse.search and it's
dependencies) I end up with 120 plug-ins which don't contribute unwanted
stuff to the ui.

Now after adding org.eclipse.search I also have to add the following
plug-ins:

org.eclipse.team.ui
org.eclipse.ui.navigator
org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources
and some others...


Including org.eclipse.search the above plug-ins contribute a lot of
unwanted ui components. Unwanted because I don't want "Team Pereference",
I especially don't want to have a "File Search" since it's a DB
application and I don't need a "Task Search".

So I was thinking maybe it's possible to refactor the
"org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.ui" plug-in and extract all the search related
stuff into an own plug-in "org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.search" or something
similar?

After removing org.eclipse.search from the Required-Plugins I get a few
compile errors, but maybe doable?</thetext>

    <thetext>Yes, I think it  feasible to extract all dependencies on org.eclipse.search. It would be straight forward to move the Task Search page. Moving other features that rely on search would require a bit more work and probably a new extension point in tasks.ui to decouple the following UI parts:

* Abstract query page implementation
* Duplicate detection
* Open in Search View action in Task List popup menu

Flavio, would you be willing to help with that?</thetext>

    <bug_when>2010-02-24 05:14:04 -0500</bug_when>
    <thetext>Ok so here is what I did and what needs to be done:

removed dependency on org.eclipse.search in org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.ui

created new plug-in "org.eclipse.myyn.search.ui" (maybe rename to org.eclipse.myyn.task.search or org.eclipse.myyn.task.search.ui)
depends on:
 ...
 org.eclipse.search;bundle-version="3.5.1",
 org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.ui;bundle-version="3.4.0",
 org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.core;bundle-version="3.4.0",
 org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.core;bundle-version="3.4.0",
 org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.ui;bundle-version="3.4.0",
 org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.net;bundle-version="3.3.0"

moved org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.ui.search to new plugin
moved org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.ui.TaskSearchPage to new plugin

created new SearchUtil class (currently in org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.ui package org.eclipse.mylyn, probably the wrong location please tell me where I should put it)
SearchUtil contains openSearchDialog() and runSearchQuery(), see attachment.
currently it contains the implementation (compile error) this implementation should now be provided by an extension point

Use SearchUtil in:
org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.ui.actions.OpenTaskSearchAction
org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.ui.actions.SearchForRepositoryTask
org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.ui.actions.ShowInSearchViewAction
org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.ui.actions.TaskSelectionDialog

org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.ui.editors.TaskEditorDescriptionPart
org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.ui.views.TaskListFilteredTree
org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.ui.wizards.AbstractRepositoryQueryPage

I noticed that some times the search dialog is opened in different ways, I think SearchUtil could use only one (not sure).
new SearchDialog(PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow(), pageId).open();
NewSearchUI.openSearchDialog(PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow(), pageId);

So now I don't have any compile errors except SearchUtil.
Still stuff to do:
move extension points from plugin.xml to new plugin.
create new extension point which is used in SearchUtil to provide search functionality.
maybe call it org.eclipse.mylyn.search.provider, which provides an implementation of maybe ISearchProvider.

Should I do the final steps and send you the plugins? I'm not sure of you naming conventions so, maybe you could then clean it up?

    <thetext>That sounds very good Flavio. I have created a new plug-in org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.search which has some of the search releated classes and extension points. I just copied stuff over and haven't yet reviewed the details so it probably doesn't work in its current state. Please take a look at the new plug-in and comment on bug 304086 what else should be moved into the search plug-in.

It would be great if you could go ahead and attach a patch with the extension point to bug 304099. You can find information on contributing patches at http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn_Contributor_Reference#Patches .</thetext>

    <thetext>Today I have tested the changes from decoupling the search.
Works for me!

Afterwards I tried out what happens when I remove o.e.ui.ide from the dependencies of o.e.m.tasks.ui.

I get three compile errors, all related to attachments.
org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.ui.wizards.AttachmentSourcePage
org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.ui.editors.TaskAttachmentEditorInput
org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.ui.commands.OpenTaskAttachmentInDefaultEditorHandler

The last one is because of TaskAttachmentEditorInput implementing IStorageEditorInput.

I haven't looked further into it, maybe it is a rather small effort to decouple this dependency?</thetext>

    <thetext>My sense is that the biggest challenge for resolving this bug are the dependency on org.eclipse.ui.editors and org.eclipse.ui.view which add transitive dependency on org.eclipse.ui.ide. I currently don't see any straight forward way for getting rid of these. 

If there is sufficient interest we could consider extracting generic UI components from tasks.ui such as the task list viewer but those efforts would need to be driven by concrete requirements since it's a significant amount of work.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks for the context Sam. It got me on the right track for the filtering aspect, which I think I have the barebones skeleton in place for.

The task updating workflow is a little vauge to me -- there's not a lot of comments so I've been relying on the context browser to guide me around (super handy, by the way!) For setting the attributes, this is my current plan of attack:

* I took a look at the SynchronizationJob's and their factory for generaring them.
* Eventually, this leads me to a lot of `updateTaskData` statements and I've discovered a TaskDataManager which eventually delegates to a connector. For "Tasks", or at least a Task as I know it, I believe I should be setting the attributes here, and looking up any particular mappings and setting them.
  * Blaine could be doing this and we could store the data as mappings in here? It's possible.
  
A few questions spring to mind...

 1) Why does a "BugzillaConnector" have an updateTaskData method? It doesn't manager "Tasks", right?
 2) At what point does it make  sense to set this indiciator? Maybe it should be done when a "review" changes?
 3) If the above, any suggestions on where to hook in a listener?
 
 Thanks!</thetext>

    <thetext>Steffen mentioned the need for a category that aggregates all incoming. This would simplify reviewing new incoming (ideally sorted by modification date).
We may want to contribute this to all tasklist modes.</thetext>

    <thetext>Steffen, perhaps you could post your thoughts here regarding adding filter completed to the tasklist toolbar since these two seem like similar use case.</thetext>

    <thetext>Yes, that would be nice. Like a filter on the task list. 

One reason why I still can't completely rely on Mylar to track incoming changes is that completed tasks automatically disappear. These should be displayed as long as they have incoming changes even when filtering of completed tasks is on (I can't find the corresponding bug).</thetext>

    <thetext>Completed tasks are displayed if they have incoming changes, and I haven't seen any bugs with that.  There is the scenario where you have a query for only open tasks, and so once resolved those will disappear from your query.  But because we have "guaranteed visibility" for tasks with incoming, they will end up showing in the archive category.  

While I think we could have an "incoming" presentation mode, I think that having a separate category would be a slippery slope so I'm changing the description to focus on the problem.</thetext>

    <thetext>In my task list completed tasks are filtered regardless of their change status. When I toggle the filter I can see all the tasks returned by the query (including completed ones with an incoming icon). Is there a setting for that or has that been fixed recently in CVS head (I am still running the EclipseCon dev build and 3.3M5 on my notebook)?</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks for the hint Mik, that fixed it. Now I need a way to mark tasks as read without having to create task objects for all query hits (bug 159221) and not have all hits marked as having incoming changes when creating a query (bug 177591) :).</thetext>

    <thetext>Some more suggestions to improve the incoming presentation:

 * Order incoming changes chronologically
 
 * Indicate which bugs have had the most activity since last read
 
 * Allow quick scrolling through tasks: Possibly display the tooltip next to the task with a readable presentation of all changes. This would be very similar to email notifications which usually provide a short description of the task and all changed properties. Also a keyboard shortcut for marking a task as read should be added. This would allow quick scanning of changed tasks similar to an email reader without having to open an editor for each changed task (which is slow compared to browsing the task list). 

If all that is implemented I will consider to stop using Bugzilla notifications :).

Don't we already have it? Well, right now it only show last comment, but it does show all the changed attributes. Though we still need to fix that for the new tasks and show submitter, description and few other common attributes, like component...</thetext>

+1 for per-repository grouping, or better repo + project grouping.

btw, IF we had grouping as a first class feature for the task list (like my first implementation before Mik insisted on using presentations) this incoming presentation could have been simply flat and user could choose the grouping that works the best.</thetext>

issues with current implementation

What is the plan in regards to this presentation? It feels really confusing that issues are grouped by assignee, wich in some cases look really weird (see screenshot). 

I think it would make more sense to group by repository + project, but we may need api from bug 199818 and some support in repository connectors that have concept of project.

Also, if this presentation is active and you mark issue as read, read issue is not filtered out from the list.</thetext>

    <thetext>This isn't currently a priority for 2.2.  Agreed about the problems, not sure I agree with the proposed solutions.  I think that we should resurrect this once we have iterated figured out changes related to bug 206566 and sorting of incomings in the current presentations.</thetext>

    <thetext>This presentation is available in the Sandbox.  We don't currently have enough indication that it is working well enough to promote out of the Sandbox.  If anyone is using it and has thoughts about improving it's usability or utility please post here.  

As a meta-point, I think that we have "room" in the UI for three default presentations, and I think it would be useful for them to show up on the toolbar and be toggled via single-click (similar to the iTunes UI for presentations).  In the 3.x timeframe I think that we should figure out if there is a useful third presentation, and "Incoming" still appears to be the top candidate.</thetext>

    <thetext>Toaster popups are nice because they often give you enough info to mark a task as read and you can see a few tasks at once. It would be nice to have a similar view that shows a larger number of incomings with details about what changed and with a mark all read button. Maybe it could even do some kind of automatic grouping, e.g. all tasks that were marked completed, all tasks where the subtasks changed, all tasks with new comments, and have a mark as read button for each group.</thetext>

    <thetext>I've committed some improvements to startup related to orphaned tasks.  Deferring further changes to 2.3 since risk of destabilizing is high.  Early in 2.3 I'll update AbstractTaskContainer to use a hashmap and will write unit tests to ensure url refactoring works correctly for all AbstractTaskContainer descendants including categories. This should result in considerable performance improvements.</thetext>

&gt; Fixed. The task editor only shows a single link for Trac tickets now.

Using latest weekly build 20090212-1700 I cannot confirm this for Eclipse 3.3.2.
Both hyperlinks are detected: first the Task hyperlink (this is OK), second the Trac hyperlink.
And the Trac hyperlink is display on top of the Task hyper link rendering it unreadable (bad).

Finally, neither clicking nor Ctrl-clicking on the task reference works. Previously, Ctrl-click worked
in the same way as it did in Java comments -- I am not sure whether in edit or preview mode.

WikiText hyperlink markup in preview mode

Here is a Trac ticket link "#100" in a Trac Rich Editor description in preview mode.
You can see the hovers stacked over each other, hiding the more interesting one (first detected) below.

If I move the mouse over the link, the first hover appears rather quickly, the second one takes a second or so.
I also notice that the colors are different and that the second one is displayed with "Press F2" to focus.

Please remember: This is Eclipse 3.3.2.</thetext>

OK, managed to click on the link (without Ctrl) and the it opened the Task Rich Editor (correct).
But the double hovers are really annoying.

It might be a little confusing: in the editor you must press Ctrl, except in the preview and non-editable areas, where you musn't press Ctrl.

&gt; But the double hovers are really annoying.

I agree.</thetext>

    <thetext>From what I can see duplicate hyperlinks are being detected as follows:

# by org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.ui.editors.TaskUrlHyperlinkDetector
# by the Trac WikiText markup parser

What we need is a way to disable one of the two when used in the task editor.  This problem affects the task editor whenever the markup language detects hyperlinks in the markup without special syntax.
Perhaps the markup language should be able to say when it detects such hyperlinks. MarkupTaskEditorExtension could filter hyperlink detectors for those languages.</thetext>

    <thetext>Fixed: added @MarkupLanguage.isDetectingRawHyperlinks()@ which is consulted by MarkupTaskEditorExtension.  For markup languages that return true, MarkupTaskEditorExtension disables org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.ui.editors.TaskUrlHyperlinkDetector.  

For markup languages where @MarkupLanguage.isDetectingRawHyperlinks()@ returns false we may still see the double-detection issue if the text of the hyperlink anchor is the same as the URL.  I don't think that we can do much in those cases.  Luckily they should be uncommon.

you bet, that's exactly what I've done.</thetext>

    <thetext>Task Hyperlinking does not work for Trac markup:
 * In edit mode, the links are neither clickable nor have a hover.
 * In preview mode, they are resolved as normal web links and the hover shows the http link. Clicking on the link does not open the rich editor, but the Trac web page in the web browser.

On the other hand, closed tasks are marked by strike-through, so I guess that here is missing a small bit.

The project properties are set to point to the relevant Trac repository.</thetext>

&gt; I assume that you're using Trac markup for a Trac task editor.  I've tried it
&gt; out and it works fine for me.  I'll attach some screenshots.

Yes, my screen shots would look like yours. But the difference is:

1. Hovers do not display the bug description, but a HTTP link to the web page of the Trac task.

2. Clicking on the hyperlink opens a web browser, but I would expect to open a rich task editor with the other bug inside.

If I use the Task Hyperlink using "#123" from a Java source code comment using Ctrl-Click it opens the rich task editor.

Shall I also try Ctrl-Click and expect a normal click to open the web page?

Will be back on my Laptop in about 10 hours to try further suggestions from you.

    <thetext>So we've got a couple of issues here:

# the Mylyn task editor link is showing up twice, when it should only appear once
# on Eclipse 3.3 only the first hyperlink would be clickable and no choices presented
## this makes me think that the Mylyn task editor link should come first, since a Mylyn user is unlikely to want to open the link in a browser</thetext>

    <thetext>&gt; # the Mylyn task editor link is showing up twice, when it should only appear

Can you file a separate bug for that against Trac? It appears that both hyperlink detectors are returning task links.

&gt; # on Eclipse 3.3 only the first hyperlink would be clickable and no choices
&gt; presented
&gt; ## this makes me think that the Mylyn task editor link should come first, since
&gt; a Mylyn user is unlikely to want to open the link in a browser

I am not sure if we are able to control that. Is the browser link is coming from WikiText? In the case of the task editor it is probably sufficient to rely on Mylyn for detecting task links.

Sounds good, see bug 264612 Looks like a TaskHyperlinkDetector and a TracHyperlinkDetector are being used.  Here are the ids of all the hyperlink detectors in use:
[org.eclipse.mylyn.java.hyperlink.detector.stack, org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.ui.hyperlinks.detectors.url,  org.eclipse.mylyn.trac.ui.hyperlinksDetectors.Trac, org.eclipse.mylyn.sandbox.ui.hyperlinkDetector, org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.ui.hyperlinks.detectors.task]

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; # on Eclipse 3.3 only the first hyperlink would be clickable and no choices
&gt; &gt; presented
&gt; &gt; ## this makes me think that the Mylyn task editor link should come first,
&gt; since
&gt; &gt; a Mylyn user is unlikely to want to open the link in a browser
&gt; 
&gt; I am not sure if we are able to control that. Is the browser link is coming from
&gt; WikiText? In the case of the task editor it is probably sufficient to rely on
&gt; Mylyn for detecting task links.

We should be able to control that.  The order of the hyperlinks is determined by the order of the hyperlink detectors, which is controlled by WikiText.  I've created bug 264611 to track this one.

Jörg, looks like task hyperlinks are being detected correctly.  Feel free to resolve this issue if you think there is nothing else.

    <thetext>Build ID: M20090211-1700

Steps To Reproduce:
After updating MyLyn to the latest version (v3.1) the Trac authentification does not work anymore. I changed nothing else and all worked perfectly before the update.

A look into the Apache logfile give me the following information:

before the update:

ip - username [19/Mar/2009:10:30:01 +0100] "POST /project/login/xmlrpc HTTP/1.1" 200 168
ip - username [19/Mar/2009:10:30:01 +0100] "POST /project/login/xmlrpc HTTP/1.1" 200 3075

after the update:

ip - - [19/Mar/2009:10:04:22 +0100] "HEAD /project/login/xmlrpc HTTP/1.1" 401 -
ip - - [19/Mar/2009:10:04:22 +0100] "POST /project/login/xmlrpc HTTP/1.1" 401 401
ip - - [19/Mar/2009:10:04:22 +0100] "POST /project/login/xmlrpc HTTP/1.1" 401 401

    <thetext>Yes of course. I get always the error "Unable to authenticate with repository. Login credentials invalid.". But the password is correct because my SVN access works perfectly with the same username and password.

Trac worked yesterday until i updated to the latest Mylyn version. I restarted Eclipse and Trac does not work anymore. I changed nothing else on my system or the server.</thetext>

&gt; Yes of course. I get always the error "Unable to authenticate with repository.
&gt; Login credentials invalid.". But the password is correct because my SVN access
&gt; works perfectly with the same username and password.
&gt; 
&gt; Trac worked yesterday until i updated to the latest Mylyn version. I restarted
&gt; Eclipse and Trac does not work anymore. I changed nothing else on my system or
&gt; the server.

I am also using the newest version from the weekly update site. This version has been promoted to the 3.1 release so the software should be the same.

If I have some time to switch to the real 3.1 release, I could test whether it continues to work for me (Trac 0.10.4).</thetext>

    <thetext>I have the same issue.
After updating Mylyn and the Trac connector to version 3.1.0.v20090315-1500-e3x, I can no longer authenticate against my Trac repository, and it worked perfectly before.
I have tried removing the old and creating a new repository - no luck.</thetext>

    <thetext>I believe this is the same issue I was facing. I had 3.1.1.v20090411-0400.e3x installed, but calls via HTTP were not sending the basic authentication header (I verified this using an HTTP proxy.)

I tried upgrading the 3.2 weekly build, but that fared no better.

I ended up having to disable all the Mylyn plug-ins and then go through and uninstall every version but the base v3.0.5 that came with my Ganymede install. 

Rolling back to v3.0.5.v20090218-1800-e3x and then installing the Trac connector has resolved the issue for me.</thetext>

    <thetext>Dan, it would be helpful if you could provide additional details about your configuration such as the Apache authentication module used etc. to help reproduce the problem.

    <thetext>Here you go:

Apache 2.2.4
Trac 0.10.4
Python 2.4
XMLRPC Plug-in 0.10 (r5577)
mod_auth_sspi v1.0.4.2.2.2

I'm also using a self signed cert and force everything through HTTPS.

What's weird is watching the HTTP traffic, the authentication header just never gets sent. I wish I would have saved my HTTP logs, but all I was seeing was 3 consecutive failed requests to: https://server/xmlrpc/login

None of the request past the basic authentication header. All of the version of Mylyn that do work, all pass the header.

Here's my location info:

&lt;Location /&gt;

    AuthName "server info"
    AuthType SSPI
    SSPIAuth On
    SSPIAuthoritative On
    # set the domain to authorize against
    SSPIDomain [domain]
    SSPIOfferBasic On     # let non-IE clients authenticate
    SSPIOmitDomain On     # keep domain name in userid string
    SSPIBasicPreferred On # basic authentication should have higher priority

    # require the Trac Users group
    require group "[group name]"
&lt;/Location&gt;

Also, as I said I am using SSL with a self-signed 128bit cert.

Let me know if you need more info.

    <thetext>When Mylar starts in a new workspace, it presents the user with a dialog box asking for some configuration. Frankly, having read through the options once, I now always just accept the defaults. I wonder if the dialog is necessary; as users become more sophisticated in their use of Mylar, they will know to go to the workspace preferences to change these settings, so IMHO, the dialog is unnecessary.

My primary concern is the inclusion of Mylar in packaged Eclipse images produced by the EPP project. I think that Mylar is a valuable contribution to these packages, and really want it included. However, this dialog is just one more thing that may slightly frighten/startle/confuse new users of the package. I may be over-reacting a bit, but I believe that every little bit counts as far as the user experience is concerned.

So... it'd be nice to see the dialog disappear on the EPP packages. Perhaps the dialog can be shown the first time the user actually touches Mylar (i.e. connects to a repository, creates a category, or creates a task). Perhaps we can just include a preferences override that provides acceptable defaults in lieu of showing the dialog.</thetext>

The original solution what I thought  is not working. It has dependency problem.
Then I added a listener to the java.ui activator JavaUiBridgePlugin which listens to the the Task List view activation or opening.
I only listen  to the List view. I think the Repositories view listening is not necessary.</thetext>

    <thetext>Balazs: thanks for the patch, that was a good start.

In the end I had to redesign the wizard some since some option were not relevant.  Instead of making it show on first Task List view activation I made it show on first task activation.  This is a bit better because the preferences the wizard sets are not relevant until a task is activated.</thetext>

    <thetext>When using keyboard navigation and "sticky" tooltip in the task list (F4). tool tip stays on top even if task list loses focus, for example when switching to editor (task editor on Enter, or other editors on Ctrl-F6 or F12) or other view (Ctrl-F7). It need to be deactivated as soon as task list loses focus. 

Tooltip can be also shown on the mouse roll over and task list view can be not in focus at that time, but because in this case tooltip is activated with the mouse it need to be tracked differently.</thetext>

current and suggested tooltip

I mostly using tooltip to read the ending of the task summary, and it is quite uncomfortable for this purpose. See top image on this attached screenshot.

The main problem is that text which you want to read jumps aside, so you have to start to scan it from the beginning. But then shown text label is not the same that you could see in the task list, because task id is not being shown on the tooltip.

If you look at the native tooltips, they are shown right in place, so it allow to continue reading labels without interruption.

I've tried to put a possible UI mockup that sould improve tooltip usability (bottom image on the attached screenshot). Though I am not sure if tooltip should overlay selected row or it should be shown on the row below selected one.</thetext>

    <thetext>I agree with the proposal.  However, if we do this we will still need the special case that that the tooltip does not move off the edge of the screen if there is not enough room, since the default Task List location is the right side of the workbench.</thetext>

&gt; does not move off the edge of the screen if  there is not enough room,

In that case we can probably use the same tootip position, but wrap the summary text.

&gt; Eugene: what's the status of this?  Is it worth exploring the current patch or
&gt; should we consider first moving to the new JFace ToolTip support?

I haven't actually submitted any patches to this issue, after I've been blamed about breaking something on OS X. I may still have some code around, that implementing aligning tooltips to the cell content in the tree view. Like before, it does not change any events, but changes calculation of tooltip position.

I took a quick look at the jface tooltips and it seems like they all bound to the mouse pointer - hence not going to help for this. See http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/JFaceSnippets</thetext>

    <thetext>I'll address this within the next few weeks. Now that the tool tip can be made visible through the keyboard (F4) and stays visible when another task is selected the positioning needs to be improved anyways.

Unfortunately platform is moving slow on bug 205872 which affects people using the task list on a second monitor. We might have to duplicate JToolTip to improve the positioning of the tool tip.</thetext>

I can't commit until I get a positive feedback from one someone with a multi-monitor setup, sorry. It would be sad if mylyn duplicates code because of this.

You can fixup the location. The default is to show them at the cursor position.

Steffen, please note that tooltip location is only half of the story. The text shown on the tooltip should be also aligned and match the selected task list entry (as on attached mockup screenshot). 

I actually had this implemented even without jface tooltips, but didn't want to submit patch for that because everybody seem sensitive about any changes in that code.</thetext>

    <thetext>Guys, can you please reconsider to use the same label between tooltip and the task list entry. The major point is that you don't have to eye-jump to the tooltip text that is currently shifted because of the task key (see the difference on my screenshot).</thetext>

+1 for the entry being the same (i.e. the same label as the Task List shows).

    <thetext>Steffen, it looks really great, and I really like how tooltip stick when you do the browse and mark as read with the keyboard (F8) it is enormous and long awaited usability improvement and even more then one would expect from those shortcuts, because of the way tooltip is behaving. 

Though there is a little glitch in positioning. When task list have scroll bar and tooltip is shown on task entry that have incoming changes, after you click F8 (mark as read and go to next) tooltip is shown not next to the entry selected after this operation, but one entry below. It seems somehow related to the scrolling.</thetext>

Yes, I have noticed that as well. It can also happen that the tooltip disappears when the tree scrolls "too much". It might be possible to fix the problem by listening to scroll events.</thetext>

positioning on windows

Steffen, the new label look really great, though now it is actually possible to see that tooltip is off 3px on windows. Also, it have duplicated label with the bug number on second line, perhaps need to be addressed on bug 205861 (so as the task icon should be shown on first row and repo icon on the second, next to the repository)</thetext>

Tom, this tooltip is heavily bound to Task List view. I've opened bug 210186 to allow to reuse it in other places, but it is still fairly specific to Mylyn UI.

Steffen added focus listener to the tooltip component that hides tooltip when focus is lost. Perhaps you could do that in the tooltip itself, though it is unclear at that point that listener should be unregistered and it is also strange that tooltip class does not provide regular dispose() method.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks Leo, patch applied. 

Tom, I'll review the current Mylyn tooltip code and make suggestions for backporting. We would like to make the tooltips feel more native (e.g. by using the same gradient for the background) but I haven't looked into that, yet.</thetext>

    <thetext>Tom: do you know if it's possible to get native (e.g. gray gradient on Vista) tooltips that have composites in them?  The square yellow box look is looking dated on Vista.

    <thetext>After installing latest nightly (2.2.0I20071121), I'm experiencing that I'm no longer able to expand certain queries (see screenshot). This happens when "Filter completed tasks" is enabled and the query contains only a single, completed task. This is especially annoying, as the query may show incoming changes on this task.</thetext>

    <thetext>The highlighted query is not expandable when platform is started with "filter completed tasks" enabled. 
If you disable, it becomes expandable. Then re-enabling "filter completed tasks",  the little "+" sign goes away (which is correct).</thetext>

    <thetext>Andreas, can you check query tooltip if this query have any incompleted tasks? With filter completed tasks there may not be anything left under that query.</thetext>

    <thetext>Andreas, then it is working as expected. Incomplete tasks are filtered out, so there is nothing to show. Those completed tasks should appear if you type matching criteria in the "find" box.</thetext>

    <thetext>Mhhm. I think 3 things are still strange:
1) To have an incoming changes mark when no such task is visible. But this might be by design.
2) To have a + sign on a query that is not expandable and
3) To have the expansible state change by toggeling filtering twice (not consistent w/ 2)

Not a major issue though- quickly figured out why that happend- it should 'felt' wrong.</thetext>

    <thetext>For 1) there are bug 208089 and bug 205202; 2) seem like a regular issue with SWT tree widget, it doesn't try to get children before "expand" event (some folder in Navigator view will show + on an empty folder before you expand it first time;

BTW, you can try to hit F6 (go to next unread task), it will bring up hidden subtask that causes issue 1).</thetext>

    <thetext>Eugene: as you know, we still cannot apply your patches.  For the time being, please suggest implementation approaches before providing patches.  

Note that we ask everyone to propose implementation before providing a patch in order to avoid getting patches that we are unable to apply: http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Mylyn_Contributor_Reference#Tips  This situation is different and we may be able to apply this patch at a later time, but for the time being it is still best to follow this tip to ensure that you don't produce contributions that we cannot consume.  </thetext>

    <thetext>Good catch.  Fixed for both notifications and tooltips.

Steffen: we could consider adding a common test method for this, but it's a simple test of "task.getLastReadTimeStamp() == null" so not too bad to have duplicated.</thetext>

While loading class "org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.ui.ITaskHighlighter", thread "Thread[Worker-5,5,main]" timed out waiting (5000ms) for thread "Thread[Worker-0,5,main]" to finish starting bundle "update@../../add_plugins/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.ui_2.3.0.I20080125-1200.jar [284]".

    <thetext>After debugging the problem in more detail my understanding is now that the bytecode verification can trigger loading of  the ITaskHighlighter class when the ContextUiPlugin class is loaded:

&gt; at java.lang.Class.getDeclaredConstructors0(Native Method)

This is a JVM native call that verifies ContextUiPlugin. It triggers this call that loads ITaskHighlighter:

&gt; at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClassInternal(ClassLoader.java:320)

The attached patch works around this by adding a "layer of indirection" to creating ITaskHighlighter.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks for your configuration details. This problem turned out to be more tricky than expected. An updated build [2.3.0.I20080214-1500] is now available from the weekly update site:

 http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/downloads/
 
Olivier, it would be great if you could verify that the warnings don't appear anymore with that build.

I have added a comment to bug 194157 in regards to the copyright header. </thetext>

    <thetext>Excellent!  Thanks Olivier.  Who would have thought that lazily starting a Task-Focused Interface would be so difficult!  At least for Mylyn 2.3 and later the startup will finally be entirely de-coupled form workbench start.

Steffen: I think that our remaining priorities related to this for Mylyn 3.0 should be bug 218856 and ensuring that some kind of safety to prevent clients from triggering unsafe initialization.  </thetext>

    <thetext>This is a follow up from bug#195691 about the new requirements emerged from screenshot attachment story.

While working on that bug, I felt the need to add more features to LocalAttachment class. Since it is actually strongly tied to the notion of content coming from either a file or a byte[] from clipboard, and due to the time constraints to get it into 2.3, I opted to do the simplest thing that could possibly work, and subclassed it, adding my needs into ImageAttachment class. Now it is time to refactor :)

The screenshot attachment story has some specific needs:

- The attachment is created from a business object (Image), not a existing file.
- The object being attached is not the same that is being created from. The Image needs to be converted into JPEG data, which is what is attached. So, there is a notion of attachment source, which produces the final attachment data.
- The attachment data production (convert into JPEG or any image format) is an expensive operation. It must be done lazily. The attachment object must have a method to trigger this data production.
- The data production must be triggered only if needed. Actually, it is needed not only when you hit finish (obviously), but when you go to the preview page (to display the exactly image which will be submitted). If you go to preview and hit finish, you don't need to create the data again.
- The user may go to preview page (triggering the data production), go back to crop/mark up page, and modify the original image. In this case, the final data must be recreated when you return to preview page or if you hit finish directly. The attachment model must support the notion of "dirty" data.
- The attachment model should have a "clean" callback method, so the temporary image file may be deleted after submission.

Now my opinion about LocalAttachment class:

- It's object interface is strongly tied to the existing attachment contents/sources. It is either a byte[] for clipboard attachment, or a File. This doesn't smell good, and it should be good to decouple and/or generalize content handling, and only leave general attachment attribute handling on this class.</thetext>

    <thetext>That sounds like a great proposal. Separating attachment meta data from the content will significantly improve the attachment API and make it more extensible. I would like to consider additional requirements in this refactoring of the attachment data model for 3.0:

- Offline support for attachments: Provide a facility in the tasks framework for caching downloaded attachments. Also support saving of attachments to submit them at a later time. A client that is accessing attachments should not be concerned how the content of an attachment is handled, i.e. if it is stored in a cached local file or in the remote repository or if it has not been submitted, yet.
- Unify ITaskAttachment, FileAttachment, RepositoryAttachment, LocalAttachment and ImageAttachment into a single class hierarchy that is decoupled from TaskData.
- Decouple the attachment wizard from the task editor.

This refactoring ties into other changes I have been making to the way task data and attributes are handled. To get started I would like to create a new class TaskAttachment that has a reference to a source object that provides the actual content, e.g.:

public abstract class AbstractTaskAttachmentSource {

	/** Returns the content of the attachment. */
	public abstract InputStream createInputStream(IProgressMonitor monitor) throws CoreException;

	/** The default file name for the attachment. */
	public abstract String getName();

	/** The size of the attachment. */
	public abstract long getLength();

	/** Disposes any temporary resources. */
	public void dispose();

}

In the case of attaching screenshots the attachment source would be managed by the attachment wizard or screenshot page. It could create a temporary file on the first call to createInputStream() that could be deleted once the source is disposed. It would be recreated in case the screenshot is disposed after it was created. 

My thinking is to duplicate the current attachment wizard implementation (i.e. create a NewAttachmentWizard2 class) and to start hacking on it without risking to break the current implementation. I could take a first pass on the weekend starting with the data model.</thetext>

    <thetext>I have attached the first pass for refactoring the data model. The code in the patch is incomplete and does not work. It is just meant as a basis for further discussion.

Willian, it would be great if you could take a look at AbstractTaskAttachmentSource and its implementations in TaskAttachmentWizard. AbstractTaskAttachmentSource is the class that I am proposing for separating attachment data from attachment properties. Here is how this could work:

- The first wizard page creates a source object that is an instance of AbstractTaskAttachmentSource. In the case of the screenshot page the source object could be managed in the attachment wizard to keep it separated from attachment specific code. Alternatively a generic screenshot editor class could be extracted that is not coupled to a wizard page and would be even more reusable by other projects.
- The second page is the preview page that displays the contents of the source object by invoking reateInputStream() on the source. The ImageSource class used for screenshots could (re)generate the image in this method if needed. 
- The third page is a potentially connector specific page for editing properties of the TaskAttachment object.

If this make sense to you I will go ahead and implement the data model specific parts to make the patch actually work. Based on that it would be great if you could do the refactoring of the attachment wizard / image generation / preview page code. What do you think?</thetext>

    <thetext>Hi Steffen, I think it is a good start.

Some questions:

1 - Why did you move the dirty state handling into ScreenshotAttachmentPage? I'm not sure if it is a good idea to have this state into a view.

Actually, this attribute is only need by the screenshot/image attachment type, but it sounds like the best place to it is in the attachment model, because it is tied to the attachment data lifecycle.

2 - This is related to (1): do you think it is better to move laziness handling out of the attachment model? The problem I see is that clients of model will have to track if the data was created or not, or it must be recreated.

Also, with (1), you have the preview page and the attachment creation job interacting with the screenshot editor page to handle the dirtiness. This is something that worried me when working on ImageAttachment, and I thought an better design was to move this state into the attachment model.

In ImageAttachment, they are markDirty() and ensureImageFileWasCreated() methods.

What about moving markDirty() into TaskAttachment, and renaming/moving ensureImageFileWasCreated() to some more generic name, like prepareAttachmentData() (or a better name)?

prepareAttachmentData() is a no-op for attachments that don't need sophisticated data handling (anything but screenshot attachment, actually). It could be an empty implementation in TaskAttachment; overrided and implemented in ScreenshotAttachment.

prepareAttachmentData() is called from every place that needs the "final" data: actually preview page and attachment job. This method is lazy: the second call has no effect, and the clients of this class don't need to know the dirty state; just call the method and let it handle all checks for you.

markDirty() should be only used by ScreenshotAttachment and other possible attachment types that modify the object being attached.  Other attachment types shouldn't have to ever need to know about this method; just ignore it.</thetext>

Patch

I think it is better to explain with code.

This patch contains proposal for modifications in TaskAttachmentWizard and AbstractTaskAttachmentSource reflecting my previous comment. In TaskAttachmentWizard I only modified the ImageSource inner class to fit the proposal.

If we go on with this design, the ensureAttachmentDataWasCreated() calls in preview page and attachment job should be modified to something like getAttachment().getAttachmentSource().prepareAttachmentData(). The markDirty() in ScreenshotAttachmentPage should be modified to getAttachment().getAttachmentSource().markDirty().

This is an quick and dirty code, I didn't really tested it.

* I added dispose() method that was missing in the original AbstractTaskAttachmentSource.</thetext>

    <thetext>I designed the AbstractTaskAttachmentSource class with IStorageEditorInput in mind. IStorageEditorInput provides an abstract way to access content by providing a lightweight object that does not hold on the actual data model but is closer to a descriptor. In the case of ScreenshotAttachmentPage I think the data model is the image that is managed in the page. My sense is that the dirty state is a property of the page or of that image but not of the data input. The ImageSource has an optimization that stores the image (data model) in a temporary file but it could as well always recreate the image and not worry about writing to a temporary file or managing dirty state.

Putting the handling of the dirty state into the abstract class makes the API contract of AbstractTaskAttachmentSource more complicated although this functionality is only needed for screenshots. I am not sure what the benefit is of exposing the optimization that is only used by ImageSource to every client (preview page and attachment job) and implementor (FileSource, ClipboardSource etc.)?</thetext>

    <thetext>I have committed a first pass of the revised API to head. The implementation is along the proposal in comment 2: 

An object of type TaskAttachmentModel is shared between the wizard pages. The model has a reference to the attachment source which is determined by the selection on the first wizard page. The source provides an input stream to access it's data. The input stream is used for the preview and attachment submission. 

The meta data that is provided by the user is stored on a TaskAttribute and managed by the connector. A new factory method has been added to AbstractRepositoryConnectorUi that allows connectors to provide their own page for editing, e.g. JIRA needs to disable the description field:

 public IWizardPage getAttachmentPage(TaskAttachmentModel model);
 
The default implementation will use the attribute mapping that is specified in TaskAttachment.</thetext>

experimental patch

Timing is probably bad, but here is what I have, just in case whoever will be working on this functionality will find it useful.

After looking at this wizard I wonder why it is not using LocalAttachment instance to communicate changes between wizard pages? 

Also, it makes sense to use content type chooser to select what image format should be used for attachment, though it should be filtered out for clipboard attachments</thetext>

    <thetext>In addition to recognizing images when creating from clipboard, I think it is important to add some button to screenshot editor itself, like "Paste from Clipboard" because I often find myself having to capturing many times until I get a good adjustment.

So in this case you can just hit PrintScreen and press the button to paste a new screenshot from clipboard as many times as necessary, and don't have to cancel/restart the wizard.</thetext>

While Print Screen is definitely valuable, it is advanced user functionality and does not remove the need for an explicit capture button.

+1 for Willian's Past action suggestion.

    <thetext>Hooking up attachment from clipboard is a no brainer, but with markup page it doesn't look pretty. 

Willian, now that your screenshot markup stuff is in, will you have chance to look at this? I took a quick pass trough your stuff and it seem like there is a big misalignment around ImageAttachment and IImageCreator, ie, ScreenshotAttachmentPage should allow to set image from outside and attachment can flip between ImageAttachment and LocalAttachment based on selection of the file or workspace resource. Shouldn't logic you have in ImageAttachment actually live in the PreviewPage, which can keep the state and listen to changes from the other pages using some kind of resource/image change listener.</thetext>

Sure.

I think it is better to cleanup LocalAttachment/ImageAttachment first. I opened bug#222833 for that. Feel free to add your opinions in there.

Once it is done, I guess this one would be a piece of cake to fix.</thetext>

    <thetext>From a quick glance at AbstractAttachmentHandler.uploadAttachment() it seems to require an AbstractTask object as a parameter. The API needs to be changed to solely rely on TaskData/RepositoryAttachment otherwise we won't be able to support that.

When considering that I would additionally like to investigate if attachment support can be decoupled from TaskData to enable web-based connectors to support context attachment without implementing full-blown offline support.</thetext>

&gt; Do you want a key binding for the action in the meantime?  E.g.
&gt; Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R or something shorter if you can come up with a reasonable one
&gt; that has no conflict.

That would be better then nothing, but can you please create binding context for the Task List and use 2 key shortcuts that would work only in the Task List? I.e. Ctrl-R, or maybe something that email apps are using.</thetext>

&gt; I can't get accelerator underlines to appear for context menus on Eclipse in

Of course they are. There is a flag in XP themes configuration like "show accelerators only when Alt is pressed", I have it disabled.</thetext>

    <thetext>We've addressed this via the Alt+R and Alt+U keyboard actions.  No further plans to change the accelerators, but we can consider menu changes on bug 211012.

    <thetext>hyperlink detection creates one hyperlink if the 'java class' prefix is found preceding a word. (eg: java class Object)
The word is passed to the Java search engine to find matches for the given class name.  If multiple search results are found the hyperlink should allow the user to choose the desired one rather than arbitrarily choosing the first one as it does now.

    <thetext>Yes, I think that would be a good solution. Mylyn currently supports Eclipse 3.3 as well as 3.4 though so this would have to be implemented through reflection or by back-porting the 3.4 hyperlink presenter.</thetext>

    <thetext>The downside of using multiple hyperlinks is that the Java search has to be done in the hyperlink detector rather than in the hyperlink -- which means that the penalty is paid even if the user doesn't click on the link.  This could be a major problem for editors that have dozens of comments with class references.  I like the idea of it working more like the CTRL+SHIFT+T (Open Type) functionality of eclipse, where the search is done at the time of clicking as it does now.</thetext>

&gt; which means that the

&gt; major problem for editors that have dozens of comments with class references.

I think we are already searching the Java class to minimize false positive, e.g. JavaResourceHyperlinkExtension.isResourceExists(..). Maybe its not a good idea to do that, any comments to improve the performance as well as the flexibility of the extension point, e.g. bug 240423?

    <thetext>That's a very good point David. I agree that delaying the processing until after the link is clicked is better. As Owen points out JavaResourceHyperlinkExtension.isResourceExists() already does some processing though. Owen, does it make sense to not do that in the case of Java where we don't know how long it will take?

To present multiple matches we could popup a menu in case there are multiple matches similar to the 3.4 hyperlink presenter but I am not sure how well the user interaction would work if searching for the class takes a while.

&gt; Another compromise that I can come up with its to drop the absolute path of a
&gt; IJavaElement, e.g. org.foo.bar.ITask.

I do like the short form. I think I would even prefer if it matched on just "class" or "java". Would it be possible to drop the full qualified name when a modifier is pressed, i.e. it's a copy rather than a move operation?</thetext>

&gt; Owen, does it make sense to not do that in the case of Java where we
&gt; don't know how long it will take?

I added a patch in bug 244380 to fix it.

&gt; To present multiple matches we could popup a menu in case there are multiple
&gt; matches similar to the 3.4 hyperlink presenter but I am not sure how well the
&gt; user interaction would work if searching for the class takes a while.

I used a popup dialog in my last patch. I like it! You can try if it fits.

&gt; I do like the short form. I think I would even prefer if it matched on just
&gt; "class" or "java". Would it be possible to drop the full qualified name when a
&gt; modifier is pressed, i.e. it's a copy rather than a move operation?

I am not sure I totally understand this point. Its possible to drop the full qualified name to the task editor.

I was suggesting to either paste the short name or the full qualified name depending on the dnd operation. It seems that the package explorer deletes the source file if I a use move operations (rather than copy) so it might be best to only support copy.</thetext>

It won't. Please take a look at TaskEditorDropTarget.dragEnter(..). It will convert all move operations to copy.

    <thetext>TaskHyperlinkDetector currently only detects hyperlinks correctly for regions of 0-length.  This is due to the API of java class AbstractRepositoryConnectorUi:
@public IHyperlink[] findHyperlinks(TaskRepository repository, String text, int textOffset, int lineOffset)@

Note that the method takes a textOffset, with no length.  The implementation of this method in BugzillaConnectorUi only returns hyperlinks that overlap the provided @textOffset@.
This blocks bug 167941, which should be able to reuse the TaskHyperlinkDetector to find TaskHyperlinks.  It also fails to fulfill the contract specified by IHyperlinkDetector, which takes a region as an argument.</thetext>

patch that adds new API for detection of hyperlinks covering a region

This patch adds new API for detection of hyperlinks in a region of text.
The old findHyperlinks API is deprecated, and the new API calls the old one so that subclasses still work.
The new API is implemented in BugzillaConnectorUi

    <thetext>I agree that the current hyperlink detection API is not generic enough to be reused to resolve bug 167941. I am a bit concerned about the performance impact of the changes proposed in the patch though.

Invoking document.get() creates a copy of the whole document each time hyperlink detection is triggered. Considering that task hyperlinking works in any textual editor this could potentially lead to significant temporary memory allocation for large documents. 

There are also performance considerations when matching regular expressions on the whole document. This could be slow for complex regular expressions (e.g. JIRA) or large documents.

I'm not sure what the best abstraction for the hyperlink detection is. The intention of the current API is to avoid code duplication between connectors but I find the method signature difficult to understand and to implement.

Maybe it would be better to encapsulate the common code in a utility method  and change the API to resemble IHyperlinkDetector more closely?  </thetext>

&gt; Great! I'll merge the patch once 3.0.2 is released. We'll also need to implement
&gt; a few test cases for finding multiple hyperlinks for the various connectors.

Agreed regarding test cases.  The attached patch has no test cases, and only alters the BugzillaConnectorUi implementation: I left Trac, JIRA and all of the others alone.  Let me know if you'll take care of these, otherwise I'll try to set aside some time.</thetext>

    <thetext>While reviewing the new API I decided to revert the changes to AbstractRepositoryConnectorUi and to use the existing method for detecting hyperlinks instead of adding an additional method. The main reason being that I found it impossible to specify the new method in a way that provided full backwards compatibility while maintaining a simple signature. 

The default implementation of the proposed findHyperlinks() method would always pass 0 as the index into text when invoking the existing implementation of findHyperlinks(). This would cause most existing implementations to return an empty list (unless the hyperlink was actually at the beginning of the text).

Clients are now expected to return all matching hyperlinks when the passed offset into text is -1. It is likely that existing implementations will return an empty list in that case but that is acceptable as detecting multiple hyperlinks will require changes to existing implementations at any rate.</thetext>

    <thetext>I am getting errors when trying to apply the patches. It appears as if you checked out org.eclipse.mylyn as a top-level project. Please make sure that each project, e.g. org.eclipse.mylyn.bugzilla.core or org.eclipse.mylyn.bugzilla.ide is its own top-level project.

I would also suggest to skip externalizing features for now and worry about those later.</thetext>

    <thetext>Implement an extension point for contributors to add to the repository properties wizard page UI.  This new feature will facilitate adding configuration UI for properties that are not a part of the repository-specific plug-in, such as the task editor extension.</thetext>

&gt; I'm okay with the current mechanism that allows additional contributions through
&gt; the menu. Having a setting in the properties dialog would have the advantage of
&gt; making all settings available in a single place though.

Users should be able to make all settings in one place.  Having a menu though easier to implement makes for a confusing UI, since users will have to remember to go to one place for some settings and another place for other settings.

&gt; David, do you have ideas how this could work UI wise? Would extensions be able
&gt; to contribute additional expandable sections?

We could take two tracks on this one:

# an extension point for contributing expandable sections to the existing wizard page
# an extension point for contributing new pages to the wizard

I like the idea of having a single page for the properties dialog, so I prefer option 1.  I've already made good headway in this direction, and I expect to have a patch ready sometime in the next couple of days.

It's conceivable that option 2 would be desirable in the case of a large set of complex options being contributed, however I don't see a use case for that right now.  Currently we only have the need to add a few simple settings.

Let me know what you think!</thetext>

a first draft of an extension point and implementation

Attached a first draft of an extension point for contributions to the task repository settings page.
The extension point is implemented for LocalRepositorySettingsPage only.

The extension point is implemented to provide Task Editor Extension settings in the sandbox ui.

With the patch you should be able to right-click the Local task repository in the Task Repositories view and see a Task Editor Extension section in the settings wizard.

If the patch looks good, the java class AbstractRepositorySettingsPage could extend the new java class AbstractExtensibleRepositorySettingsPage, which would enable the extensibility for all repositories.</thetext>

    <thetext>This is looking good David. A couple of thoughts:

* What is the reason for making AbstractRepositorySettingsPage extend AbstractExtensibleRepositorySettingsPage? I am not sure if there could be another use case for extending AbstractExtensibleRepositorySettingsPage so it would be easier to have all code in a single class.
* Renaming validateSettings() to validateServerSettings() breaks binary compatibility.
* All API additions should be tagged with an @since 3.1 comment.
* ITaskRepositoryPageContribution seems very similar to IWizardPage except that it does not have access to the wizard and wizard container. Instead it uses a listener interface to communicate with the parent class. It makes the interface nice reusable by not coupling it to IWizard but on the other hand gives the contribution less flexibility, e.g. for manipulation the wizard message. Are there other examples in JFace or SWT where a parent registers a listener with a child to get notified to trigger validation? I have a preference to follow the design of the platform to make it as easy as possible for integrators to understand the API.</thetext>

&gt; This is looking good David. A couple of thoughts:

Thanks for the feedback

&gt; * What is the reason for making AbstractRepositorySettingsPage extend
&gt; AbstractExtensibleRepositorySettingsPage? I am not sure if there could be
&gt; another use case for extending AbstractExtensibleRepositorySettingsPage so it
&gt; would be easier to have all code in a single class.

The local repository settings page doesn't extend AbstractRepositorySettingsPage since it has much different behaviour.  Keeping them seperate is a good separation of concerns, since AbstractRepositorySettingsPage makes lots of assumptions about what's on the page (such as there being a server with a URL)

&gt; * Renaming validateSettings() to validateServerSettings() breaks binary
&gt; compatibility.

Agreed, that should be fixed in a new patch

&gt; * All API additions should be tagged with an @since 3.1 comment.

Agreed, though when I tried to do that the PDE plug-in created an error saying that it should be @since 3.0.  I knew that 3.0 was wrong, so I left the @since tags out until I could get some advice from you.

&gt; * ITaskRepositoryPageContribution seems very similar to IWizardPage except that

I also saw that similarity and started out by using IWizardPage.  I determined that IWizardPage was not a good fit for the following reasons:

IWizardPage has lots of API that we don't want, for example:
* performHelp
* image descriptor
* visibility
* getNextPage/getPreviousPage
* reference to wizard
and is missing some API that we do want:
* ability to participate in validation
* ability to apply settings to a repository

Ultimately in this case it makes sense to have a purpose-specific API, otherwise we'll carry some 'not-a-perfect-fit' baggage.

&gt; Are there other examples in JFace or SWT where a parent registers a listener with a
&gt; child to get notified to trigger validation? 

I haven't seen any, but on the other hand I haven't seen this kind of extensible UI either.

&gt; I have a preference to follow the
&gt; design of the platform to make it as easy as possible for integrators to
&gt; understand the API.

I fully agree with this last statement.  
I also believe that fit-for-purpose APIs are better than trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.

I'm open to any design ideas that you might have.  This is a first stab at the problem, and I'm not married to the design.  The listener mechanism (for example) is a way of the contribution letting the page know that it needs to be validated.  If you have better/different ideas about how this might be done, please let me know.</thetext>

&gt; assumptions about what's on the page (such as there being a server with a URL)

Agreed. I missed that the local page extends AbstractExtensibleRepositorySettingsPage which makes perfect sense. From the naming it sounds like it has more functionality than the existing class but that's what we will be stuck with to maintain backwards compatibility (maybe AbstractBaseRepositorySettingsPage would make that more clear).

&gt; &gt; * All API additions should be tagged with an @since 3.1 comment.
&gt; 
&gt; Agreed, though when I tried to do that the PDE plug-in created an error saying
&gt; that it should be @since 3.0.  I knew that 3.0 was wrong, so I left the @since
&gt; tags out until I could get some advice from you.

Interesting. I have had to setup an base line that contained all plug-ins of the Eclipse SDK and all Mylyn plug-ins to fix similar errors.

Very good points. I agree that we'll need a custom API in this case and the listener approach seems like a good way of coupling the parts. As long as we can encapsulate the boilerplate code in an abstract class this should work well for implementors.

&gt; Some suggestions, mostly on making the names less implementation-centric:

Sounds good... but it's not just for comments. (Description too)
How about 'Text Editor'?

&gt; * "None" -&gt; "Plain Text"

Yes

&gt; * What's the special "Bugzilla Dialect"?

This is related to bug 237120, bug 242939 and bug 245476
Basically it's a few enhancements to Textile to make it more optimal for use with Bugzilla

&gt; * "Wiki Links" is not self-explanatory, what is it?

It's the 'wiki link pattern', that is the URL to the wiki associated with the issue tracking system.  See bug 237678 for details
Perhaps 'Wiki URL Pattern' would be better?</thetext>

I've had some thoughts on this one: do we actually have a use case where the wiki URL cannot be derived from the connector URL, or retrieved via the connector itself?  Perhaps the UI for this configuration item should go away.

Yes, however this is not useful if the markup language used does not support notation for 'internal' links.  Furthermore, these links would only be visible within the Mylyn client, not the web application.

    <thetext>I think we are almost there :). Thoughts from reviewing the latest patch:

AbstractExtensibleRepositorySettingsPage.findApplicableContributors() should check for an empty string rather than "*" to be more consistent with other Mylyn extension points.

Why does ContributionComparator compare the hashCode() if titles of contributions are equal instead of returning 0?

Instead of using IStatus[] I would prefer if methods only returned a single IStatus and a MultiStatus was used to aggregate status objects. 

Instead of adding ITaskRepositoryPageContribution and AbstractTaskRepositoryPageContribution to the API the abstract class should be sufficient (see https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=17547394&amp;postID=6323554618318168270&amp;pli=1 comment 5).

The names of ITaskRepositoryPageContributor and AbstractTaskRepositoryPageContribution are very similar. At best I would like to avoid requiring a factory implementation at all and only keep the abstract class. How about adding an init(TaskRepository) method to AbstractTaskRepositoryPageContribution instead of passing the repository in the constructor? To allow contributions to programatically check if the contribution applies for that task repository it could return a boolean. Generally I would like to start moving these checks into xml that is expressed in the extensions to avoid loading classes for contributions if they are not needed similar to how enablement works for command contributions in the platform.

I am still not entirely sold on the listener concept. Why not give AbstractTaskRepositoryPageContribution access to the ITaskRepositoryPage, e.g. through the init() method? That way contributions could call other methods on the wizard and the container, e.g. for running jobs or accessing the form toolkit held by the page.

Thanks for getting to this one, I'll iterate on it again.

&gt; 
&gt; AbstractExtensibleRepositorySettingsPage.findApplicableContributors() should

Sounds good.

&gt; 
&gt; Why does ContributionComparator compare the hashCode() if titles of
&gt; contributions are equal instead of returning 0?

Contributions may not be the same even if their titles are.  The code should have been comparing the contributions themselves when the strings are equal, not the titles.  I'll fix it.

&gt; 
&gt; Instead of using IStatus[] I would prefer if methods only returned a single
&gt; IStatus and a MultiStatus was used to aggregate status objects.

Sounds good.

&gt; 
&gt; Instead of adding ITaskRepositoryPageContribution and

No problem.  As an asside, it seems odd to me that the 'Abstract' prefix is used for abstract classes that are API for which there is no interface.  Usually the 'Abstract' prefix is used to indicate that it's an abstract default implementation of something else.  In this case there is no 'something else'.  People may find this confusing.  What are your thoughts?

&gt; 
&gt; The names of ITaskRepositoryPageContributor and
&gt; AbstractTaskRepositoryPageContribution are very similar. At best I would like to
&gt; avoid requiring a factory implementation at all and only keep the abstract
&gt; class. How about adding an init(TaskRepository) method to
&gt; AbstractTaskRepositoryPageContribution instead of passing the repository in the
&gt; constructor? To allow contributions to programatically check if the contribution
&gt; applies for that task repository it could return a boolean.

The factory design pattern has advantages over the init with boolean idea:
* factory design pattern is well-known
* the Eclipse platform makes use of the factory design pattern for other similar cases (see IAdapterFactory, AbstractServiceFactory, ITabbedPropertySheetPageContributor, AbstractTaskEditorPageFactory, etc.)
* it provides a nice sparation of concerns
* it's simple

&gt;  Generally I would
&gt; like to start moving these checks into xml that is expressed in the extensions
&gt; to avoid loading classes for contributions if they are not needed similar to how
&gt; enablement works for command contributions in the platform.

That's a great idea!

&gt; I am still not entirely sold on the listener concept. Why not give
&gt; AbstractTaskRepositoryPageContribution access to the ITaskRepositoryPage, e.g.
&gt; through the init() method? That way contributions could call other methods on
&gt; the wizard and the container, e.g. for running jobs or accessing the form
&gt; toolkit held by the page.

While giving the contribution access to the ITaskRepositoryPage may be a good idea for other reasons, the contribution itself needs to have a way to inform the task repository page that its state has changed.  There is currently no API available to do this on ITaskRepositoryPage.  Listeners are a way to solve this problem without changing the API on ITaskRepositoryPage.  Do you have any other suggestions?

Thanks again for your feedback, I'll iterate on this one again and create a new patch.</thetext>

I agree that the Abstract prefix is superfluous in this case and there are examples in the Eclipse SDK for omitting it (e.g. Job, WizardPage). Mylyn has been fairly consistent in using the prefix with few exceptions (e.g. TaskDataCollector, SubmitJob) but I am definitely in favor of more concise naming. Mik, what are your thoughts on this?

I was thinking of something like this but didn't realize that getContainer() is protected:

 getPage().getContainer().updateButtons();

I just realized that validation is more complicated than I first thought. The settings page support two different ways of validating: User input validation (immediate) and connection validation (long running). Is there a use case thar requires extensions to hook into connection validation?

reworked patch

Steffen,

Re-worked the patch as per your suggestions and Mik's naming issues.  I think that I got them all.  Notable changes:

* it's against head after the taskEditorExtension was moved out of the sandbox, so two classes have been moved
* naming follows Mik's suggestions
* Uses abstract class instead of interface
* removed Wiki Links configuration (we can add it back in later if necessary)
* uses IStatus and MultiStatus instead of IStatus[]
* re-enables default taskEditorExtension repositoryAssociations

Please look it over and let me know what you think.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks for your efforts and patience David. The API looks very good now and it's great how well documented it is! I have done minor renamings in the updated patch: AbstractExtensibleRepositorySettingsPage -&gt; AbstractTaskRepositoryPage, addContributions() -&gt; createContributionControls() and removed the coupling to FormToolkit.

I noticed a few remaining nits in the implementation that should be addressed before the patch is applied:

* The contribution extension point should require an id for each extension. This helps to diagnose problems in case instantiation of an extension fails.
* All invocations of contributions need to be wrapped using SafeRunnable to prevent a contribution from causing the whole settings page to fail.
* As far as I can tell validation of contributions is not invoked by AbstractRepositorySettingsPage. AbstractRepositorySettingsPage.isPageComplete() should probably call super?
* AbstractRepositorySettingsPage.repository is never assigned a value. It should be trivial to add an assignment in the constructor which I would prefer over making the field in the super class protected.

It would be great if there was a test case that checked if a (mock) contribution was actually added to he dialog.

Since you have already done a lot on this patch I can do the remaining work but I probably won't be able to get to it soon. Let me know if you want to iterate on the implementation again.  </thetext>

No problem, and thanks!  Documentation is key.

sounds good.

&gt; * All invocations of contributions need to be wrapped using SafeRunnable to
&gt; prevent a contribution from causing the whole settings page to fail.

makes sense to me.  Should that include the initialization methods or just validation?

&gt; * As far as I can tell validation of contributions is not invoked by
&gt; AbstractRepositorySettingsPage. AbstractRepositorySettingsPage.isPageComplete()
&gt; should probably call super?

validation of contributions occurs when contributions fire the appropriate event.
but yes, AbstractRepositorySettingsPage should call super.

&gt; * AbstractRepositorySettingsPage.repository is never assigned a value. It should
&gt; be trivial to add an assignment in the constructor which I would prefer over
&gt; making the field in the super class protected.

sounds fine to me

&gt; It would be great if there was a test case that checked if a (mock) contribution
&gt; was actually added to he dialog.

Yes, I agree.  I don't really have the bandwidth to do that.

&gt; Since you have already done a lot on this patch I can do the remaining work but
&gt; I probably won't be able to get to it soon. Let me know if you want to iterate

I'll iterate again.

    <thetext>I noticed that there are a few strings where different messages are used depending on quantity:

 if (minutes == 1) {
   min = minutes + Messages.DateUtil_minute_;
 } else if (minutes != 1) {
   min = minutes + Messages.DateUtil_minutes_;
 }

Do you know how to do this properly using ICU4J? I looked at PluralFormat but wasn't quite sure how to apply it and was wondering if it is actually used in the Eclipse platform?</thetext>

    <thetext>Original code:
			minutes = seconds / MIN;
			if (minutes == 1) {
				min = minutes + " minute ";
			} else if (minutes != 1) {
				min = minutes + " minutes ";
			}

I think that the mistake is found in the judgment of the minutes.
I think that the following judgments are correct. 
 
			if (minutes == 1) {
				min = minutes + " minute ";
			} else if (minutes &gt; 0) {
				min = minutes + " minutes ";
			}

Ex of Output;
  0 minute  =&gt; ""   (None)
  1 minute  =&gt; "1 minute "
  2 minute  =&gt; "2 minutes "

This method does the following outputs.

1 hour 1 monute 1 secound
1 monute 1 secound
1 secound
2 hours 2 monutes 1 secounds
2 monutes 2 secounds
2 secounds
1 hour 2 secounds

Sorry, i don't use ICU4J.

    <bug_when>2008-11-08 05:02:55 -0500</bug_when>
    <thetext>It is necessary to think about the date format for the internationalization. 
For example; 

Date format: MMM dd 

English:  Nov 08
Japanese:  11 08

When displaying in Japanese, should become "11/08". 

The following corrections are necessary to solve this problem. 

1) The method of the display is changed in the language
    (externalize strings of the date format), or

2) It changes to a common format. 
    (Ex;  MM/dd )

The uploaded patch only simply made the externalization. 
There is a problem also in the message text. 

English: This is BBB in AAA. 
Japanese: xxxx AAA xxxx BBB xxx.

The position of AAA and BBB in the sentence is different according to the language. 
The message should be buried and be edited when internationalizing it. 
Do not make the message by the string concatenation when internationalizing it. 

String word1 = "BBB";
String word2 = "AAA";
String message;

NG:  message = "This is " + word1 + " in " + word2 + ".";
OK:  Message = MessageFormat.format("This is {0} in {1}.", word1, word2);

After making to the externalization, I will make the correction of the date and the message. 
It is hoped that the patch is applied early.

    <thetext>I have applied the patch for commons.core but moved the date formatting method to another plug-in to avoid having a message bundle in the class. 

I believe this would be the right way of formatting the message in this case:

 String Duration_format="0#{0} hours| 1#{0} hour | 1&lt; {0} hours";

 ChoiceFormat fmt = new ChoiceFormat(Duration_format);
 System.out.println(MessageFormat.format(fmt.format(hours), hours));

The other two patches will require ip review.</thetext>

    <thetext>I have applied the patches for bugzilla-feature and bugzilla.ide. I skipped externalization of some strings in the plugin.xml of bugzilla.ide since they are not dependent on the locale.

I am holding off with bugzilla.core and bugzilla.ui for now (see bug 215116 comment 17).</thetext>

    <thetext>Rob, I'll hand this over to you. Please consider these patches as soon as other outstanding contributions have been merged. Ping me once you are ready to merge and we can go over the string externalization process together.</thetext>

    <thetext>There is a problem also in the message text.

Example;
  English: This is BBB in AAA. 
  Japanese: xxxx AAA xxxx BBB xxx.

The position of AAA and BBB in the sentence is different according to the language. 
The message should be buried and be edited when internationalizing it. 
Do not make the message by the string concatenation when internationalizing it.

String word1 = ?BBB?;
String word2 = ?AAA?;
String message;

NG: message = ?This is ? + word1 + ? in ? + word2 + ?.?;
OK: Message = MessageFormat.format(?This is {0} in {1}.?, word1, word2);

Yes I know that this was a bug in the TaskListTableSorter. But I fix this while I create patch for bug#219549.

If I remeber my right the sortorder was only used for sort by Summary.

Should we generate a fix for the 2.3 Version? If so what tag should be used for cvs.</thetext>

    <thetext>Sorry for being so slow here. I had to prioritize the patches for internationalization which have now unfortunately broken this patch. Frank, can you briefly describe how the patch changes the UI? 

It looks like there is a bit of refactoring in the patch. Would that be simple for me to do so we could reduce the overall size of the patch? If you can describe the refactorings I can take a pass at it and you could work from there.</thetext>

&gt; describe the refactorings I can take a pass at it and you could work from there.

Sorry Steffen,

I think it is better that I create a new version and we can see what you can refactor. Is this OK for you?</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks Frank. Due to the size of the patch it'll have to go through IP review. Before we start the process I would like to go over the UI and user interaction with Rob and Mik to make sure we are on the right track. The intention is to reuse the same configuration dialog for the search view, right?

If I press ok in the dialog I currently get this exception:

Yes, this is the patch to reuse the dialog.
More things that changed
1) cleanup for the compare method.
2) support for change root sortorder.
&gt; 
&gt; If I press ok in the dialog I currently get this exception:
Stange, on my system (Mac OO 10.5.4 with Eclipse 3.4.1) I did not get this error.

    <thetext>Is there another bug that has more discussion about adding an option for setting the root sort order? I am not sure about the use-case for a descending order, particularly if special folders such as Unmatched are sorted to the top. However I can see how it would be useful to group queries by repository similar to the way the list of repositories is sorted in the new task wizard. 

Generally I think top-level elements in the task list should be organized in this order. This is somewhat similar to how Email clients work:

 Uncategorized [Inbox]
 Unsubmitted [Drafts]
 Categories 
 Queries
 Unmatched [Archive]

To fix it, move the super.okPressed(); to the end of the okPressed() method in TaskListSortDialog. The super method closes the dialog and disposes the widgets.

Hi Steffen,

there is no use case for this, but I find it nice to have the option to sort the Query ascending/descending.

This is OK but why not change Sort... to Sort Container contents to ... to make clear that only the contents is sort and not the root contents.

What do you think about adding an option for choosing between alphabetical order and grouping by repository instead?

&gt; This is OK but why not change Sort... to Sort Container contents to ... to make
&gt; clear that only the contents is sort and not the root contents.

I think we can keep the current naming and add additional options for choosing the sort order of the root as long as the UI does not get overly complex (see above). Within the sort dialog itself it could make sense to say "Sort order for categories and queries" and "Sort order for tasks".</thetext>

    <thetext>I just wanted to attach a patch to a Bugzilla via clipboard and I found that it is not obvious at what time exactly the clipboard data is read.  Wouldn't it be better to read it right after the first step of the attachment wizard and display the attachment preview at that time?

The reason that I stumbled across this is that I tried to copy&amp;paste an attachment comment as well - and got completely confused ;-)</thetext>

    <thetext>Steffen, have you been using the attach in background option?  Is it worth having it around?  Tried moving it to the TaskAttachmentPage but since the connector is only returning the IWizardPage interface, we can't access a new method on the returned page. I could leave it there but it doesn't make much sense when it isn't the last page in the wizard.  Move/remove? </thetext>

    <thetext>Yes, it's not a concern of the connector and should be on one of the generic pages. Why not just leave it on the second page? 

It's too late to remove it. That would be a feature regression (see bug bug 269237).</thetext>

    <thetext>This does not work well when attaching images. Images are displayed as text when the preview page is first openend. I guess the mime type detection hasn't taken place at that point, yet.</thetext>

    <thetext>Provide a search text field that filters the connectors in the UI.  The search text field will do a plain-text search on names, descriptions etc. of connectors.

From bug 272621 comment 14:
&gt; I think it?s worth doing since we?re expecting to support stores with a large number of listings. 
&gt; Please take the ?Find? UI approach of the Task List rather than the ?type filter text? approach
&gt; that the Preferences dialog uses.</thetext>

    <thetext>Integrate the discovery mechanism by adding to the *Add Task Repository* wizard.

At this point how this is to appear is uncertain.  Likely to be either a hyperlink in the wizard UI, or an *Other...* kind added to the list of repository kinds available.</thetext>

    <thetext>In order to avoid a hard-coded dependency from tasks.ui to discovery.ui we could try adding a toolbar to the wizard that is populated through IMenuService:

		menuService = (IMenuService) getSite().getService(IMenuService.class);
		menuService.populateContributionManager((ContributionManager) toolBarManager, "toolbar:org.eclipse.tasks.ui.toolbar.addrepository");

If that's too much overhead a dependency would also be okay for now but we should move the plug-ins out of the sandbox prior to doing that.</thetext>

    <thetext>What I had in mind was integration with ICommandService.  tasks.ui could look up a discovery ui command by its id, and the command could indicate if it's enabled.  That would allow for greater flexibility in the ui.
Agreed that we should try to avoid a plug-in dependency if possible.</thetext>

    <thetext>Sounds good. I find toolbars a fairly flexible mechanism that gives contributions control over the UI (e.g. through ControlContributions) but go for whatever works.</thetext>

Steffen, that's great... btw, though it's now integrated noone will see the link until bug 275224 is completed.</thetext>

    <thetext>I was curious if/how it would fail when running bootstrapped. It would be nice if the error message was more descriptive since it seems that similar errors could happen in case of network failure or erroneous metadata.</thetext>

    <thetext>Currently all Archive categories are placed at the end of the task list. In result, active category can be far apart from the actual query node. 

I suggest, to change default sorting order and use the following rules:

-- All local categories should be at the top of the Taks List view
-- The rest of the task list should be sorted using the following order:
   -- repository (same order as in Repositories view)
   -- query nodes sorted alphabetically by query name
   -- Archive category for this repository should be placed at the end of the list
   
For example:

- My Tasks
- Uncategorized
- Eclipse/aj [Eclipse.org]
- Eclipse/Mylyn [Eclipse.org]
- Archive [Eclipse.org]
- m2eclipse [Codehaus]
- Archive [Codehaus]
- Subclipse [Subclipse]
- Archive [Subclipse]

This way it should be easier to see if query hits are dropped from queries and moved into the Archive</thetext>

    <thetext>Frank, this is related to your work on bug 231336. To resolve this bug I would suggest to add an additional combo selection for sorting of root nodes that allows choosing between alphabetical sorting and by repository sorting. TaskRepositoriesSorter contains the implementation that is used by the repository selection wizard page and if possible the code should be extracted and reused.</thetext>

&gt; Frank, this is related to your work on bug 231336. To resolve this bug I would
&gt; suggest to add an additional combo selection for sorting of root nodes that

&gt; 

Steffen, I think that we have three ways for sort here:

1) see bug #231336
  this is sorting first by types and then  alphabetical sorting of the names
2) alphabetical sorting of the names and for same names then by types
3) repository sorting and then by types (see description)

with the following type:
-  Uncategorized [Inbox]
-  Unsubmitted [Drafts]
-  Categories 
-  Queries
-  TaskGroup
-  Unmatched [Archive]

What do you think?</thetext>

    <thetext>That sounds good. Here are examples to make sure we mean the same thing:

1)  Grouped by Categories and Queries

Uncategorized
Unsubmitted [Eclipse]
Unsubmitted [Other]
Category
An Eclipse Query
Other Query
Unmatched [Eclipse]
Unmatched [Other]

2) No grouping

Uncategorized
Unsubmitted [Eclipse]
Unsubmitted [Other]
An Eclipse Query
Category
Other Query
Unmatched [Eclipse]
Unmatched [Other]

3)  Grouped by Categories and Repositories

Uncategorized
Category
An Eclipse Query
Unsubmitted [Eclipse]
Unmatched [Eclipse]
Other Query
Unsubmitted [Other]

Yes here is an posible implementation. Sorry the cleanup of the not used presentations is not done.</thetext>

    <thetext>I generalized the implementation slightly to avoid some code duplication. Frank, can you take a look and let me know if that makes sense? I noticed that the setting does not get persisted at the moment. Could you add that to TaskListView using GroupBy.name() and GroupBy.valueOf()?</thetext>

    <thetext>The patch looks really good. I like the refactoring that you made. The code reuse is much better now. Can you add a simple test case that makes sure the preference migration works?

One oddity I noticed is that Ascending/Descending would sometimes change if I selected a sort key in the sort dialog that had already been selected in another combo box. Also the enablement for Ascending/Descending doesn't seem to work if I select a sort key in the last combo box. Can you check that?</thetext>

&gt; The patch looks really good. I like the refactoring that you made. The code
&gt; reuse is much better now. Can you add a simple test case that makes sure the

&gt; 
&gt; One oddity I noticed is that Ascending/Descending would sometimes change if I

This was not a Bug, it was a Feature which is commented out now.
&gt; Also the enablement for Ascending/Descending doesn't seem to work if
&gt; I select a sort key in the last combo box. Can you check that?

All other is done.</thetext>

    <thetext>I have committed my last patch with a few additional modifications. Frank, I added groups to the UI, renamed a few classes and kept the migration code in TaskListView since that is where the memento was originally handled.

    <thetext>It is not uncommon for connectors to use Mylyn internals. It is recommended to specify a version constraint that is compatible to the corresponding major release version in that case, e.g. [3.1.0,3.2.0) for a connector that works with Mylyn 3.1. Once a newer Mylyn major release is available the version specified by the connector has to be updated and a new connector release is required. The discovery UI should support this scenario. I can see the following options:

* The old Mylyn release should not allow installation of the new connector version: 
** The discovery UI indicate that a Mylyn upgrade is required to install the connector.
** The discovery UI could support multiple versions of the same connector with different version constraints against Mylyn and allow installation of an old version of the connector.
** The connector could be hidden from the discovery UI

* The new Mylyn release show not allow installation of the old connector:
** The discovery UI indicate that the connector is not available for the particular Mylyn release if it has not been updated for the release.
** The discovery UI could hide the old connector if it has not been updated for the Mylyn release.

The version of the org.eclipse.mylyn_feature feature is representative of the installed Mylyn version.</thetext>

    <thetext>Sounds like we should discuss this one to come up with some well-defined requirements.

As far as determining the version of Mylyn, would it be sufficient to query the version of org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.core instead of the feature?  It's certainly simpler.  Take a look at ConnectorDiscoveryWizard.createEnvironment()</thetext>

    <thetext>I've imlemented featureFilter, which allows connectorDescriptors to specify a feature id and version range that must be present in order for the connectorDescriptor to remain unfiltered.  For example:

bc. 
&lt;connectorDescriptor ...&gt;
    &lt;featureFilter featureId="org.eclipse.mylyn_feature" version="[3.2,4.0)"/&gt;
    &lt;featureFilter featureId="com.foo.bar_feature" version="1.0"/&gt;
    &lt;icon ../&gt;
    &lt;overview ../&gt;
&lt;/connectorDescriptor&gt;</thetext>

    <thetext>As far as I can tell it is currently not possible to specify version constraints for the connector that is to be installed. That means if a connector only works with a certain version of Mylyn it would need to have its own update site, since the discovery component will always attempt to install the latest version. Is that correct?</thetext>

Yes, that's correct.  Perhaps I misunderstood the original enhancement?  Please reopen or create a new enhancement request if so.</thetext>

    <thetext>Shawn, do you think it's a reasonable limitation to expect connector distributors to maintain separate update sites to support multiple Mylyn versions? 

The one example where that comes to mind that currently hosts multiple versions of a Mylyn integration on the same site is Subclipse.</thetext>

    <thetext>A few more suggestions for improvement:

* Remove the indentation for connector, since categories stand out well due to the dark background.
* Move the Learn More Link to the left, it's seems natural to click it after reading the text.
* Remove the border around the image in the tooltip and don't fill the background. Contributors can frame their images as needed and it looks odd on some images (e.g. the Trac one).

I would also consider limiting the filter to the name and short description of the connector to make it more obvious why something is matching (search for "trac" for instance which also matches JIRA).</thetext>

Excellent, thanks for the patch!

    <thetext>An ideal XML format would have readily available tooling for both defining the format and for using it.  It would also be familiar to Eclipse plug-in developers, since that's our target developer group.  With this in mind I propose that we use the plugin.xml format with an extension point for defining connectors.  

Here's a sample of what it might look like.  Note that I haven't externalized strings for clarity:

pre. 
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;plugin&gt;
   &lt;extension
         point="org.eclipse.mylyn.discovery.core.connectorDiscovery"&gt;
      &lt;connectorDescriptor
            categoryId="org.eclipse.mylyn.discovery.test.sample.connectorCategory1"
            description="A sample connector for testing purposes"
            id="org.eclipse.mylyn.discovery.test.sample.connectorDescriptor1"
            kind="task"
            license="Acme Public License 1.0"
            name="Acme Task System"
            provider="Acme Inc."
            siteUrl="http://www.acme.inc.nodomain/mylyn/update3x"&gt;
         &lt;overview
               screenshot="images/ats-screenshot.png"
               summary="an overview of the connector"
               url="http://www.acme.inc.nodomain/mylyn/update3x/ats-overview.html"&gt;
         &lt;/overview&gt;
         &lt;icon
               image128="icons/ats128.png"
               image16="icons/ats16.png"
               image32="icons/ats32.png"
               image48="icons/ats48.png"
               image64="icons/ats64.png"&gt;
         &lt;/icon&gt;
      &lt;/connectorDescriptor&gt;
      &lt;connectorDescriptor
      ... snip ...
      &lt;/connectorDescriptor&gt;
   &lt;/extension&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
   
The format provides facilities for describing both the connector and the provider of the connector (in some instances they are not the same).

Packaging this format in a jar would allow for relative resource references for things such as images.  The jar need not be an OSGi bundle, since it would not be installed into the runtime.  The jar format should however be compatible with the OSGi bundle conventions to leverage existing tooling, however no OGSi-specific manifest entries are required.  As such the plugin.xml would be at the root of the jar.</thetext>

    <thetext>I have made it so that it toggles the visibility of the composite that the actual time is on based on whether there has been time logged against it.  This means that you can still see 00:00, but only if you have ever activated the task (even for a second). </thetext>

    <thetext>I experimented some more with changing the green.  But I'm concerned that this was not a sufficient improvement over the black/gray arrows to warrant deviating from the color scheme used by the Synchronize view, which is a regular part of the workflow of developers using Mylyn.  We can still use the green color for upload/download/submit elsewhere in the UI, and revisit the coloring, but I reverted the change for now and made a slight tweak to the outgoing arrow's tail.</thetext>

    <thetext>Local tasks already have a "Move to" category in the context menu.  Only repository tasks not in the Task List have an "Add to".  Note that we are also considering adding a Category drop down to the top of the local task editor.  Let us know how the current implementation meets your needs.  One invariant that I think is important to preserve, for the purpose of simplicity, is that any kind of task can only be added to a single category.</thetext>

    <thetext>I was thinking about being able to add them to a category when creating them. Therefore in the task editor and not the task list view. Just tried it out and saw that you can invoke context menu on editor and not just tasks in task list view :-)

I would prefer a category drop down at the top of the local task editor. 	</thetext>

    <thetext>Sounds good.  Please post if you start on it.  I figure that the category selection should go on the line just below the summary, and be pre-populated with the selected category if applicable (the category is pre-set to be the one that was selected in the Task List).</thetext>

    <thetext>There are a couple of use cases for non-alphabetical sorting for the Eclipse listing, and in general it seems like it would be helpful.
* We need the "Eclipse" listing to be on top, and currently "Community" sorts first.
* Within the "Eclipse" listing we will want to sort things by relevance, e.g., sorting incubation items last if we add them.

I suggest we add a "group" concept for categories, and allow connectors to specify which group they belong to.  Anything not in a group gets listed last.  For "Eclipse", we would define "features", "bridges" and "connectors" groups, which would be sorted in the order they are defined.</thetext>

    <thetext>If space for an attribute editor is limited such as in the header of the Task Editor it would be helpful to have an attribute editor that used an image for displaying the current value of an attribute. The editor should have a drop-down for selecting values from a popup menu.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks David. I have committed the patch with a few modifications: The menu was not disposed when re-created, tooltips were not properly updated and refresh was not implemented for read-only mode. There was also some dead code that I removed. Please review my changes.</thetext>

    <thetext>I reviewed the changes and they look good.

One remaining issue: the drop-down affordance (the downwards pointing triangle to the right of the icon) is black, which stands out more than normal attribute editors, which use a grey triangle.  Should the color be changed to grey?  This doesn't seem high priority.</thetext>

    <thetext>The triangle is provided by the platform and dependent on the OS theme. I don't think we should change it.</thetext>

    <thetext>Many mail and collaborative UIs make use of Alt+S for sending/submitting.  I propose that the task editor use this mnemonic or shortcut as well, since Submit is such a common action, and since Ctrl+Alt+S is hard to hit.  We should still retain the Ctrl+Alt+S shortcut for those already accustomed to it.</thetext>

patch that manages traversal

The attached patch attempts to manage focus programatically.  It works as it should, with the exception that on Mac/Cocoa the SWT Label widget refuses to accept focus.  The Label widget is used for the information image link.  We could use a Button instead of a Label, however I'm not aware of a way to style the button so that it looks as it does now (SWT.FLAT is not enough).  We could probably use a Button and paint it ourselves.  Open to feedback here.</thetext>

    <thetext>The Mylyn UI is really inconsistent. The submit button has been put as its own button at the bottom of the screen as a standalone element. 

We already have an 'action bar' at the top of mylyn, that includes 'new subtask', 'synchronize incoming changes', 'activate task' and the like. We really should have the 'submit' as part of that toolbar as well.

In addition, the placement of mylyn actions is completely at odds with the way that the Eclipse platform works. Why isn't there a 'Mylyn' menu which is active when a task is open? There's a bunch of standard operations that can be done on tasks - close, comment, reply, submit - which shouldn't need an implementation engine to redo the UI each time. 

Lastly, the Forms UI button looks cack on a Mac, and always has done.</thetext>

    <thetext>Looks like there are multiple issues here.  

I'm in favor of moving the submit button to the action bar (top of the editor), since it will save screen space.  Currently the submit button bar uses a lot of space and it's empty except for the one button.  I'd prefer to use that space for viewing other things like comment text.</thetext>

    <thetext>The idea is to put additional controls such as the personal notes or a search field on the footer toolbar once we figure out a good split with the header. We have experimented with Submit in the header but it was too easy to hit the button accidentally, e.g. when trying to refresh. Also space in the header is limited since we need to reserve some space for the message area.</thetext>

as always there are many driving forces... ;)
For me the message area is already quite large, as I'm using a 24" monitor without the outline view, so I've got lots of extra space in the header too.  I realize that this is not the case for everyone.</thetext>

    <thetext>Why is it that the Mylyn editor has to do everything inside the editor? Why not interact with the workspace at large and use some of the notification areas that the Eclipse platform provides, instead of in the editor window directly? 

As for the accidental use issue - I don't see that as being a problem. People tend to click on the right thing most of the time.

Why can't we put the submit button back where it was (for the hard-of-clicking) and then put the submit action in the mylyn action bar?</thetext>

    <thetext>In order to keep the local editor consistent with the repository editor style you could add a button to the left of its header as well.  The tougher question is what action to place there.  Two common actions that are performed on a local task are "Save" and "(mark as) Complete".  "Save" could work well in the same location because it is analogous to "Submit" since it submits to the local repository, yet it does introduce some redundancy.  I could also imagine "Complete", but don't think it is as consistent.</thetext>

The color depth of the transparent image that serves as a placeholder for the submit toolbar set to 1. Surprisingly that works Linux but I guess to make it work  for Windows we'll need to set it to a higher value.</thetext>

&gt; Why contribute it as a button? There are already buttons to the right side that
&gt; have an icon-only style. Having a button-with-text both takes up more screen
&gt; estate than is really needed and adds yet another inconsistent style into the
&gt; header.

The advantage of using a button is that it is bigger and hence easier to hit. Since submit is a frequently used action we found that it's worth the additional screen estate.

The transparency problems have been addressed. We have verified that the submit button now looks okay on Gtk, Win32 and Cocoa. Contributors who wish to use the new setting need to invoke AbstractTaskEditorPage.setNeedsSubmitButton(true) in the constructor of their editor page.</thetext>

Adding to Steffen's points, studies using the GOMS (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOMS) model have shown that the bigger a button is, the easier it is to hit.  The implication for UIs is that it is helpful for frequently used actions to use bigger affordances.  Some of the new Microsoft and Apple UIs demonstrate this: http://blogs.howtogeek.com/mysticgeek/files/2008/09/1116.png

The send button is used so frequently that we believe it deserves more real estate than the typical 16x16 tool button. It is also helpful for it to be in a location that is close to where the user is mousing when working on tasks, and that is easy to hit (e.g., a corner).

Those interested in this discussion should also follow bug 272093 since the design of the Submit location is related to our redesign of the header.</thetext>

That's an implication with no real proof, though. What computer users want is consistency, and Mylyn has fast become the very antithesis of consistency in the user interface - and this is making it worse. There are already a selection of 'actions' that are present in the top-right of the window; somewhat arbitrarily, you're deciding on using a completely different style to extend new functionality elsewhere. 

This, to me, really shows that you've not considered consistency at all in the design of the Mylyn user interface. Whether something is bigger (or smaller) actually doesn't ahve any real effect for those who know where it is - witness how easily anyone can close a window, or minimise it, for example. In fact, good user interfaces (generally those found in Mac applications) tend to work precisely through consistency. It's arguably the case that the reason why Linux has never really taken off through the desktop is due to lack of consistency between applications - but at least then, the applications are often self-consistent. Mylyn manages to be inconsistent with itself...

&gt; The send button is used so frequently that we believe it deserves more real
&gt; estate than the typical 16x16 tool button. It is also helpful for it to be in a
&gt; location that is close to where the user is mousing when working on tasks, and
&gt; that is easy to hit (e.g., a corner).

Have you done any studies on this, or compared it to the number of times other actions are clicked on? Or done any comparative reactions by showing people two and asking which they prefer is? Or are you just justifying your implementation? Can you show that if it were an icon (with the rest of the  bug actions) that it would be measurably more difficult to hit with a mouse? After all, aren't they the same size as the close, maximise and minimise icons on each view which Eclipse developers seem to have no problems with hitting?

&gt; Those interested in this discussion should also follow bug 272093 since the
&gt; design of the Submit location is related to our redesign of the header.

Adding more lines of cruft, for no real proven benefit and a increase of discordance in what is already a pretty inconsistent UI isn't going to help anyone. The purpose for filing this bug is to complain about the amount (and positioning) of screen real estate in the vertical view. Putting the submit button in the header but making that header bigger to accomodate - when there's a perfectly good collection of actions to the right - is what this bug was raised against in the first place. </thetext>

    <thetext>Alex: To briefly address your accusations, no we do not have proof that this is better UI nor do we have user study data, or the resources to perform another user study on Mylyn.  The main input to our UI design is the expertise that the committers have collectively built up via user feedback and monitoring of users in various forums.  We also regularly conduct UI reviews, and have done those with the Eclipse UI Working Group.  We are open to input on our UI design process.  The document have been using for brainstorming UI design is: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn/UI_Design

In terms of consistency, we first follow the Eclipse UI guidelines, then the Windows and Mac UI guidelines, and then create exceptions if we perceive a sufficient productivity gain.  In the case of putting the Submit button on the left of the header, I'm not sure what guideline we are breaking, since the left area of the header is custom to Eclipse Forms.  Just so I'm clear, is your complaint regarding consistency that we will be incosistent with Forms that use that area for title text?

Either way, I would prefer not to quibble too much on process here, but to get your opinion on what a better design would be.  Where do you suggest that we put the icon?  The key constraints we have identified for typical users (i.e., those that don't use the Submit shortcut) are:
* Button should always visible even if the editor has scrolled, otherwise the user has to waste time scrolling back to it and may have trouble noticing it
* Bottom (i.e., common footer) is not appropriate because we can't use that real estate well and will have blank space
* The top-right of the toolbar is already crowded and contains a different button style (16x16 icons)
* The button needs to be big enough to hit easily, since it is equivalent to Send in an email editor</thetext>

Proposed screenshot of inserting 'submit' action on top-right

(In reply to comment #19)
&gt; Alex: To briefly address your accusations, no we do not have proof that this is
&gt; better UI nor do we have user study data, or the resources to perform another
&gt; user study on Mylyn.  

OK. So citing a 'bigger is better' report doesn't particularly address this case then, either. 

&gt; * The button needs to be big enough to hit easily, since it is equivalent to
&gt; Send in an email editor

This is basically the point that I have problems with. There's pretty much no other UI guidelines (for any app/os) that says something like 'Make the most used button bigger than others'. In a dialog, do you make 'OK' bigger than 'Cancel' because you think that's most frequently used? What about any of the other operations/toolbars/actions in Eclipse? Do you make the Git icon that much bigger because I'm always using Git?

The point is that this 'requirement' is a somewhat arbitrary decision and not actually based on any key metrics. In fact, it's perfectly possible for the submit button to be added to the existing icons on the top-right, as the attached shows. Arguably, that provides a more consistent user interface than the split view above (although note this was put together with a cut-n-paste image editor, rather than through code, so the position of the icon in the list is suggestive rather than prescriptive). One could imagine it being on the right-most icon of the actions to ensure a consistent location.

The further can-o-worms that opens up is what happens when others ask for different icons to be put there. With the massive-sized button (relatively) taking up that much space, you won't get more than a few icons before the toolbar becomes full. So what criteria are used to decide whether to put something here, especially if others then start contributing actions to this point? Note that arguments like 'it's the most frequently used ...' then start to go out the window if others can add any other buttons to this list, or the set grows over time (they can't all be the most frequently used).

Having already got action-specific buttons in the top-right of the editor, I don't really see any reason (or special-case) why the 'submit' button can't also be there. Eclipse users are already familiar with view actions (e.g. JUnit's re-run tests, which gets used a lot more than the 'submit' bug does; debugger's pause/play/resume; enable/disable breakpoints; minimise/maximise buttons). These are all of equivalent size, and there's no suggestion that these aren't easy to hit.

Lastly, Mylyn's editors already diverge from the standard Eclipse model. I don't think there's any great benefit in making that division wider than it otherwise needs to be. Users are familiar with view actions, and though infrequent, other editors support icon-based actions in the top right (update site has 'build' and 'help' in top-right; PDE's manifest editor has 'play', 'debug', 'help' etc.). In other words, to date, no editor has had any kind of clickable action on the top left; and none have a 'button' anywhere at the top of the header, preferring instead the icon-based actions.

So, I ask again - why do we have this pseudo requirement of 'it must be a big button'? What gives the 'submit' button this much specialness that it's worth diverging further from the Eclipse standards? If there's no data to show it's better as a button (but rather a gut feeling) then why not try to keep the current standards in place and see how that goes? There's already actions that are repository-based here (refresh, show in browser, new task etc.) so it will fit in well with those kind of actions - but at the same time, being standard and unobtrusive yet still facilitating easy submission throughout the UI regardless of scrolling location.</thetext>

    <thetext>I was able to fix the remaining nits and have committed the patch. The submit button is not contributed to the toolbar by default. Extenders of AbstractTaskEditorPage need to invoke setNeedsSubmitButton(true) in their constructor to enable the submit button for their editor.</thetext>

submit on Carbon 3.3.2

Installed the weekly build into Eclipse 3.3.2 Carbon to see what it looks like and the submit is slightly clipped on the bottom. Looks fine on 3.4.2 though. Submit button is off-center on both, needs some tweaking.</thetext>

    <thetext>The new tooltips look great!

David, I have committed a new viewer to commons.ui that is used by the integrated bug reporting and has some similarities with the discovery wizard (screenshots are on bug 212209). The implementation is based on a StructuredViewer which provides filtering and sorting for free but still uses custom controls for the list items. It is intended to be generic but I don't know if it fits your use-case well. You can take a look at ControlListViewer and ControlListItem if you are interested. Feel free to take make any changes required to generalize the implementation. Note that I haven't tested the classes much other than making them work for the support wizard (Help &gt; Report Bug of Enhancement).  </thetext>

&gt; David, I have committed a new viewer to commons.ui that is used by the
&gt; integrated bug reporting and has some similarities with the discovery wizard
&gt; (screenshots are on bug 212209).

Thanks Steffen it looks good.  We should look at integrating this when it won't introduce risk into the project.  Currently we're working to a deadline so I'd prefer to focus on that.
BTW, I noticed that ControlListItem has some mac-specific code keyed on comparing the platform to "carbon".  You may want to make that work for Cocoa also.</thetext>

Good point. I copied that bit from platform. We should definitely review that code before moving it to a non-internal package.

I agree that we should consider the integration after release when we have more time.</thetext>

&gt; David, can you change the policy to always allow contributions from local

How about a system property to disable the check?  I'd prefer not to open it up for all plug-in extensions.</thetext>

    <thetext>Sorry, I missed your comment. Properties are hard to discover and will leave testers wondering why their contributions are not visible. 

What is the main concern with category contributions from installed features? My understanding is that the use-case for loading extensions from installed bundles is testing. Even if a plug-in defined a category I don't think the discovery mechanism needs to actively prevent contributions from plug-ins that were deliberately installed by a user.</thetext>

&gt; Properties are hard to discover and will leave
&gt; testers wondering why their contributions are not visible. 

Agreed

&gt; What is the main concern with category contributions from installed features?

In previous discussions we agreed that categories could only be created if they meet certain approval criteria.  Currently the only way to manage this is via the directory.  Installed bundles are not referenced in the directory, thus by default their category-creating permission is turned off.

&gt; My understanding is that the use-case for loading extensions from installed
&gt; bundles is testing. 

Though this is a valid use case we should not assume that people will use it only for that purpose.

&gt; Even if a plug-in defined a category I don't think the
&gt; discovery mechanism needs to actively prevent contributions from plug-ins that
&gt; were deliberately installed by a user.

This statement is contrary to previous discussions.  If we need to reconsider, then let's do that.  Perhaps a discussion at the next weekly meeting.

Keep in mind that categories should rarely be created.  We only expect to have a few, and they'll be done as part of 3.2.  So while your concerns are valid they may only affect a person once or twice over the next few years.

    <thetext>The driver for adding this restriction was to control the contribution of categories on the Mylyn discovery portal. The intention was not to generally limit category creation. I believe that category contributions should be allowed by default and explicitly disabled instead of the other way around. 

The discovery code is fairly generic and may get reused by others in the future. It's an unnecessary hurdle to require integrators to discover a magic system property for enabling contributions (I am not aware of any other Eclipse extension with a similar requirement). In addition it makes testing more difficult if a contribution does add categories or if an extension specifies a custom category.

Mik, what are your thoughts?</thetext>

&gt; limit category creation. 

I'm not sure if that satement is correct.  My understanding is that the intention was to prevent arbitrary creation of categories.

&gt; The discovery code is fairly generic and may get reused by others in the future.

The discovery code is currently internal and should not be reused by anyone in its current form.

&gt; It's an unnecessary hurdle to require integrators to discover a magic system
&gt; property for enabling contributions (I am not aware of any other Eclipse

Integrators should not be creating categories.  So none of them should encounter this problem.

&gt; In addition it makes testing more
&gt; difficult if a contribution does add categories or if an extension specifies a
&gt; custom category.

Agreed, though as afore mentioned this issue should only be encountered when the Mylyn team decides to create a new category, which is unlikely to occur often.

&gt; 
&gt; The discovery code is currently internal and should not be reused by anyone in

Even if an implementation is in an internal package there is always a chance that it will get reused by others and we should aim for supporting that within a reasonable effort.

I do not follow that argument. We simply can not anticipate all use cases of integrators, e.g. for a discovery portal that is internal to a company. We know of environments where users are not allowed to install extensions unless they come from internal sources.

It is possible that discovery jars that are not maintained by the Mylyn project will be permitted to contribute categories.

&gt; that it will get reused by others and we should aim for supporting that within a
&gt; reasonable effort.

There is always a chance, I agree _however_ there is no requirement in the discovery project for supporting a reusable API, particularly not in internal packages.  Until the requirements change I don't see any need to support such usage.

&gt; &gt; Integrators should not be creating categories.  So none of them should
&gt; encounter
&gt; &gt; this problem.

&gt; of environments where users are not allowed to install extensions unless they
&gt; come from internal sources.

The requirements of this project as set out in previous discussions is to only allow creation of categories in cases where it's approved.  I'm open to changing those requirements; however until those requirements change we should not open it up.

&gt; It is possible that discovery jars that are not maintained by the Mylyn project will be permitted to contribute categories.

See above; the current requirements prohibit this.

    <thetext>Reopening for discussion: What I find odd is that after installing connectors from the New Task dialog and going back after the restart I still don't see the connectors in the list (because I haven't created a repository, yet). I'm leaning towards removing the button until we have a mechanism to prompt the user to create a repository, e.g. from the Welcome screen.</thetext>

    <thetext>David: This seems high priority because we will need to have a way to link in pages like http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn_Extensions from the Community listing.  In general, I think that every category will need some sort of more detailed explanation, including the Eclipse.org one and the one that we're planning for the Tasktop Certified program.  Is it feasible for us to add the same sort of "i" link and popup for categories?</thetext>

&gt; Is it feasible for us to add the same sort of "i" link and popup for categories?

Really anything is possible.  Just specify how you want it to work... I'll make it happen.

Some things to consider:

* 'learn more' link and 'i' might make the UI look busy
* consider permitting HTML anchors in the category description text
* should links open a browser or popup information provided in the categoryDescriptor?</thetext>

    <thetext>It seems like the easiest thing to do right now is to make the "i" mechanism work for categories.  It has a nice preview with "Learn More" link on popup, etc.  We may not need a screenshot for it, but that image area could be used for larger images or logos.  So it seems like the requirements are almost identical.  I realize it will make the UI look a bit more busy, but I think it will be worthwhile in terms of ensuring that people can learn about the category without needing to fall into a web browser.</thetext>

The only thing that I find slightly weird is that categories require a screenshot (what would we put there?). Would it make sense to make the Tooltip for categories smaller if no screenshot is specified?</thetext>

&gt; screenshot (what would we put there?). 

Well, it's not actually required, just allowed.  Good point about when would we use it -- but allowing it gives us better code reusability.

Yes, that makes sense.

    <thetext>I've reworked the layout so that if an image is not provided the tooltip is less wide, and the height is only as high as needed to fit all of the provided text.  As per Steffen's suggestion I've moved the 'Learn More' link up so that both the summary and the link fit into the same vertical space as the image.  This means that there is one less line available for summary text, which could affect content for some connectors.

Please take a look and let me know what you think.  It's pretty easy to move the link back down if we need to.</thetext>

    <thetext>The patch was up-loaded. 

The context is analyzed by an original method. 
I think that can improve processing by using the bridge. 
However, I do not understand the usage of the bridge. 
I hope you improve an analytical part. 

There is a problem in the context. 
The file/folder cannot be judged from the element for the resource type. </thetext>

    <thetext>Interesting approach Hiroyuki, however, it seems that this method would fail for elements in the context other than resources and java files.  I don't think that we should provide this functionality to users until they can trust that it will contain all of the orphaned elements in the context.  To properly determine this, we may need to add some new API so that the bridge can determine if its elements are properly shown.  Let's keep this patch in mind for the next release as it would be an excellent addition to the context page once we have worked out how we can determine what elements are orphaned reliably.</thetext>

    <thetext>What we could do is iterate over all of the visible elements and all of the nodes in the context and see if the handles match.  If so, they are visible, else they are orphaned or missing and we can say that there are 50 elements not shown and provide some UI for showing the handles of the rest of the elements.  This would work for all cases.</thetext>

    <thetext>Running latest dev build with Eclipse 3.4, alt-click unfiltering is practically doesn't work. Unfiltered elements filtered back once I click on anything and it is impossible to open editor or even popup menu on those. It does not affect absolutely all elements, but when it happens it is very distracting and less passionate user would simply disable or remove Mylyn.</thetext>

    <thetext>Eugene: these changes are not necessarily final, but were by design (see bug 175655 comment#14 and the duplicate in comment#15).  But I was concerned that this would cause problems with other use cases, although I'm not sure how it could cause problems showing a context menu.  Could you please describe the exact steps that break for you?</thetext>

&gt; Could you please describe the exact steps that break for you?

Very simple. Activate some task, unfilter some element with Alt-click, doubleclick on it to open an editor, unfilter another element, try to open popup menu, then repeat. Very quick I can't open any editors or menus after alt-click, unfiltering just go off. 

This is the first time I wanted uninstall Mylyn because it is getting in a way of thought more then it is helping. It is even beyond distracting.</thetext>

I have made a bunch of related Alt+click fixes.  Could you please try again?  I could not get any failures, but the one thing I was confused about was "unfilter some element with Alt-click, doubleclick on it to open an editor", since I think the normal click stream for this is the following?
1) Alt+click package
2) Left click file to make it interesting
3) Double click file to open

Did we previously support skipping (2)?  If so it was unintentional, but should be considered.</thetext>

    <thetext>Sounds like there is some miscommunication. I didn't realize that (2) is needed. 

It essentially turning plain double click into a triple click with a mouse move in a middle. I don't think it used to be like that. 

Also, it is really confusing when selected element jumps out somewhere when you right-click on it (without left clicking first). 

So, all in all I do think that skipping (2) is important and it should be the regular behavior.</thetext>

    <thetext>Eugene, I'm aware of the following two problems that you have mentioned during a previous call:
1) Disjoint selections don't work: I have added this support and updated the doc: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn_User_Guide#Alt.2BClick_navigation
2) Double-click is not supported: this was never intentionally supported but likely worked due to performance problems.  We can try to add support fo it.

I have turned this bug into (2).  </thetext>

    <thetext>I am not sure about Linux but from the org.eclipse.ui.commands documentation it sounds like "Mod1" maps to "Command":

The modifier keys can also be expressed in a platform-independent way. On MacOS X, for example, "Command" is almost always used in place of "Ctrl". So, we provide "M1" which will map to either "Ctrl" or "Command", as appropriate. Similarly, "M2" is "Shift"; "M3" is "Alt"; and "M4" is "Ctrl" (MacOS X). If more platforms are added, then you can count on these aliases being mapped to good platform defaults.</thetext>

    <thetext> (In reply to comment #11)
&gt; Looks like we have a regression with Ctrl+click when focused.

With the current infrastructure it will be tricky to support both the request for Ctrl+click to make multiple things interesting and to set the disjoint selection.  I have updated the User Guide with the current policy: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn_User_Guide#Alt.2BClick_navigation  If this is desired we would need to maintain the our own list of disjoint selection over the viewer, which is too big a change for 2.2.  Let's see how the current policy works and consider this along with bug 175655.

Alt+double click is now supported.  Needs additional testing to make sure that we don't have a timing problem, since we now just queue the next event.  There's a good chance that should work all the time since the viewer already has it's open event queued, but we should watch for failures.</thetext>

    <thetext>I just played with current changes from the HEAD. It is still quite confusing.

Sequence Alt-click, Alt-Ctrl-click, Alt-Ctrl-click doesn't work (it filtering out expanded node on first Alt-Ctrl-click)

Sequence Alt-click, release-Alt, Ctrl-click, Ctrl-click is still only select the last element.

Sequence Alt-click, release-Alt, Alt-Ctrl-click, Alt-Ctrl-click does work (but it is very confusing to use Alt-Ctrl-click instead of simple Ctrl-click)

I am not sure if this is intentional, but it is completely unclear from the text in the user guide.

    <thetext>After additional experimentation I believe that we cannot go out in 2.2 without proper support for Ctrl+click making disjoint selections because it's too big a change with how viewers typically work.

    <thetext>I am still having issues with regular Alt-click, then double-click sequence, even for Java files. It does work when task is just started, but then it suddenly stops at some point. My only theory is that it stop working after this element been decayed so after that you can't make it interesting again. I have to use popup menu to open editor instead of doubleclick on the java file. After editor is opened resource is still not being unfiltered, so I have to close editor (editor context management is on) and after that Alt-click, Alt-doubleclick work.

This all also mean that there are most probably another issue with interesting things being decayed too fast.</thetext>

    <thetext>Yay!  I think that I finally figured out all of the problems happening around missed Alt+clicks and Alt+double-clicks.  There was a UI concurrency problems between interaction event triggered selections, our refresh policy, and timing.  We now wait OS.GetDoubleClickTime() before triggering any additional refresh.  

This boils down to the fact that both Alt+double-click and Ctrl+click after Alt+click are both supported.  More importantly, there should not be any missed Alt+clicks anymore.  Let's watch carefully for that.  A new weekly biuld will be available tomorrow.

(In reply to comment #17) 
&gt; This all also mean that there are most probably another issue with interesting
&gt; things being decayed too fast.

While I realize that it felt that way, it is very unlikely that this was the cause of the problem.  Please report if you see anything like this again.

(In reply to comment #14)
&gt; Sequence Alt-click, Alt-Ctrl-click, Alt-Ctrl-click doesn't work (it filtering
&gt; out expanded node on first Alt-Ctrl-click)

Alt+Ctrl+Click is handled the same was as Alt+Click in order to avoid confusion.  If there is a use case for Alt+Ctrl+Click to do something different please file a new bug. </thetext>

That would be the sequence I tried to use to select multiple resources from the list unfiltered after first Alt-Click without thinking about it. Releasing Alt is an extra gesture that didn't feel natural.</thetext>

    <thetext>Mik, unfortunately the current implementation does not compile on Linux. I have temporarily comment out the windows specific part. I am not sure if SWT has a platform independent way of determining the double click interval. We might have to use reflection to access these internals.</thetext>

    <thetext>Steffen: changes look good, great that you found a better way to get that timing.

Eugene: please consider commenting that you would like the Alt+Ctrl+click sequence to do something different on bug 175655 (note that this can't be done for 2.2 becuase there will be complications and because we will have to work out the right policy). </thetext>

&gt; Eugene: please consider commenting that you would like the Alt+Ctrl+click
&gt; sequence to do something different on bug 175655 (note that this can't be done
&gt; for 2.2 becuase there will be complications and because we will have to work out
&gt; the right policy).

I never suggested it should do something different. If you use Ctrl-Alt-click when to context filter is active, it works for selecting multiple elements. So it would make sense to have the same when context filter is active, unless, of course, there are technical reasons that it can't be done. 

Anyways, I already commented about Ctrl-Alt-click on one or two bug reports, so please feel free to use those comments if you like, because I simply can't keep up with you jumping between so many bug reports. :-)</thetext>

    <thetext>It seems task editor performance does not scale well with the amount of comments.

My machine is a: Core 2 duo, 2GB, Windows Vista.

If you try to open a bug with ~100 comments, like bug#8009, and compare with another one with &lt; 5 comments, like this one, you can note that:

- The first one takes more time to open the editor, ~3 seconds on my machine, the second one ~1 second.
- Expand the "Comments" section takes ~0,5 second, while the second one ~0,1 second.
- Expand a single comment takes ~0,5 second, while the second one ~0,1 second.

The comment expansion particularly bugs me, because while the ~0,1s in a "normal" bug is acceptable, it is sufficient to make the mouse cursor turn into a busy circle for a very quick moment. In the "big bug" scenario, it sounds strange because it looks like it is doing some heavy computation, but it is only repositioning the other controls.

I don't know if there is something we could do at Mylyn's side because it looks like the only thing we could optimize here is control creation and layout optimization.

I took a look at the forms API, and it appears the only way to handle the expansion correctly (and is the way actually used) is to invoke IManagedForm.reflow(true), but in the big task editor this means to invalidate and layout all the form == at least 100 * (expandable composites + icons + textviewer + hyperlinks, that composes a unique comment).

I don't remember any application that uses so many controls in a unique UI, and perhaps there should be some optimization in SWT/Forms side.</thetext>

    <thetext>Shawn: could you please put your latest Sleak profiling results here?  

Beyond finding any opportunities to share fonts or colors across comments, the underlying problem here is the fact that we instantiate multiple SourceViewers. </thetext>

    <thetext>From what I found, there is 1 color created per comment:

2 comments: 41 colors, 1 font, 12 images
69 comments: 108 colors, 1 font, 12 images

If both of these are open at the same time, the base colors (39 or so) are shared.  The main problem seems to be that there is a color per comment created.</thetext>

    <thetext>Shawn pointed out to me that the JFace DefaultHyperlinkPresenter class was instantiating a color on us because we were passing it an RGB, so changed that to pass it a color constant instead.  The number of colors should no longer grow with the number of comments.

    <thetext>I've been suffering from similar performance problems with large bugs, but it's the redraw during scrolling that's been bugging me (on Windows XP), rather than any layout time.

When viewing a task with a long list of comments, with all comments expanded, the time taken to perform any redraw is a significant fraction of a second on my Pentium-M class laptop. When paging up and down, this isn't too painful in itself - you just click on the scroll well, then wait for the content to appear.

But when scrolling up and down by dragging the scroll bar or using a scroll
wheel, with immediate scrolling enabled, you're left with a big smear of text
across the window unless you pause scrolling long enough for the redraw to happen;
the event prioritisation is such that it never gets round to redrawing any new
areas, only doing rectangle copies until you stop scrolling, giving a window full
of rendering artifacts. This isn't pretty.

The slow redraw can also be seen when dragging a window in front of the task
editor, although in that case the drag is frozen until the redraw catches up,
so you don't see visual artifacts.</thetext>

    <thetext>Kevin, I see this too, and I guess this is not necessarily because of the large comment list, but it just exposes a redrawing problem.

This is very easy to reproduce: just open any task editor with a sufficient large list of comments to have a vertical scroll bar, and scroll with the mouse wheel. You will see a "dirty repaint" effect on editor while scrolling.</thetext>

    <thetext>I am concerned that it is too easy to get into an excessive amount of use of handles with task editors, especially on Windows Vista (bug 211124).  What I have done to address this for now is put in a hard limit on task editor reuse, where the least-frequently used editor will be auto closed when the max is hit.  Dirty editors or those with incomings and outgoings will not be closed.  The max is currently hard-wired to 12 and I would like to avoid making it a preference.  It is not likely for anyone to hit max handles until they've got a few times that in number of editors open, so we can consider raising it.  However, task editor bloat has usability problems of its own, so it could be good to keep the max under 20.</thetext>

    <thetext>(In reply to comment #9)
&gt; I am concerned that it is too easy to get into an excessive amount of use of
&gt; handles with task editors, especially on Windows Vista (bug 211124).  What I
&gt; have done to address this for now is put in a hard limit on task editor reuse,
&gt; where the least-frequently used editor will be auto closed when the max is hit.
&gt; Dirty editors or those with incomings and outgoings will not be closed.  The max
&gt; is currently hard-wired to 12 and I would like to avoid making it a preference.

I am concerned about this, as with other hidden policies. Even if it is documented somewhere, it is still not very obvious to the end user when editors will be closed. For example I can envision scenario when user opens editor for the currently active task and then goes into the Task List or the Search view to browse trough some other tasks (it can go way beyond 12). In result interesting task editors will be unexpectedly closed. So, all in all property similar to Platform's "close editors automatically" will give more visibility to this feature.</thetext>

    <thetext>We have an editor with similar design to the Mylyn issue editor (multiple SourceViewers in ExpandableComposites) that exhibits similar performance problems.  We have come up with a solution that works well for our editor, drastically reducing the initialization time.  In case it might be of use for the Mylyn editor, I'm posting a summary of what we did here.

Our solution relies reducing the number of SourceViewers for a given editor instance.

SourceViewers are only instantiated if they're visible.  If an ExpandableComposite is expanded, the SourceViewer is added to it in an IExpansionListener, and if it is collapsed, the SourceViewer is disposed.  

In our editor this approach greatly reduces the number of SourceViewers that exist at any given point in time (granted if someone expands all composites, this approach would have no benefit -- however we've found that typical use rarely involves expanding all composites)

I hope that helps.

David

    <thetext>David, this is exactly what we plan to do so it is great to hear this has been done with some success! Were any extra tricks required to reduce the amount of form re-layout required after expanding/collapsing the expandable composites?</thetext>

    <thetext>I didn't mention that we also use a Composite container for each SourceViewer, where the Composite has a custom LayoutManager and no other children.  The LayoutManager might have an effect on performance, however that's not why we introduced it.  We find that the line wrapping behaviour of the StyledText is better using our LayoutManager.

I haven't yet used a profiler to analyze the new setup, so it's hard to say exactly what is working.  Our initialization time though has gone from about 2s to &lt; 0.2s.  

I'm off work now until the 2nd, and probably won't get to it until the 16th of January -- so I'm afraid that I can't give you much more information with any degree of certainty.</thetext>

    <thetext>Here are my results of a quick profiling of the improved task editor:

On open :

 - The editor spends a bunch of time doing reflows. It looks like the editor is fully "reflown"  when each section is created causing it to burn  more time the more widgets are added. Is it possible to delay reflowing until all widgets are created?

On expand of (all) comments:

 - The parser of the StyledText widgets consumes a lot of time parsing the comments. The parsing rules might need a refactoring to make them more efficient.

 - The hyperlink detector triggers SWT exceptions that are ignored but cause 30% of the overhead. That might be a Linux only problem (looks similar to bug 203991).</thetext>

don't reflow sections when opening editor

This patch supresses reflows while constructing sections. According to the profiler editor opening went down from 6 seconds to 600 ms. Rob, it would be great if you could the patch to your bootstrap workspace and let me know if you can confirm that on Windows. Please note that the patch breaks the bold font style of section headers.</thetext>

proposed implementation

I've added methods to get and set task list container to the TaskListToolTip to make it usable ouside of the TaskList, then replaced hack on cursor text with this real tooltip. 

New tooltip work on all hyperlinks in the task editor, except links to dependent and blocked bugs, but once those are replaced with SourceViewer control, it will work there too.</thetext>

    <thetext>Eugene: as mentioned before, in order to avoid creating patches that we will be slow to apply please propose a UI design before providing patches of this sort (added note on this to http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Mylyn_Contributor_Reference#Tips ).  While I think that the better tooltips for the Task List could be a good idea, I don't think that the tooltips that we use in the Task List are the right solution because they are too heavy-weight.  Also, they show incoming information that is tailored to the Task List not to task navigation, and have the sacrifice of non-native look-and-feel.  They also show other irrelevant information such as the task repository and the elapsed time.

What I think we should consider for 3.0 is improving our support of tooltips in the Task List, and if the result of that is lighter-weight, considering the reuse of a subset of that information in the task editor.</thetext>

    <thetext>First of all, this prototype looked simple and obvious enough to me to not require any lengthy "design" discussion, not to mention that turn around on these discussions is long enough, so you can save few loops and it give you chance to actually try proposed enhancement. BTW, I'd very much like to see the same unified tooltip in other places, including Task Trim.

Also note that there been few incidents, when my proposals been misinterpreted, so I hope that code or the actual UI would be easier to understand. Though there was other incidents when my code been misinterpreted too and then same changes been accepted from someone else's contribution.

Anyways, my rationale was to have consistent tooltips in all places, so tooltip used in the task list seem to be a good candidate. I don't agree that info about incoming changes and other information is irrelevant, more over it is important piece of information about task that should be available NOT only in the Task List. For example, cross-repository linking is pretty much possible with JIRA connector and repository info is NOT not-relevant for that. Besides, Task List tooltip is quite concise and reasonable compact, so I think it should be used.

I don't think there is anything to sacrifice, because Platform don't provide any "native" look and feel for any other tooltips, but I suspect that you are referring only to to one (not yet most popular) OS/UI variant and may also biased to the some specific non-IDE tooling. Users of those tools may don't care about advanced tooltips, but as a developer I do care about any additional information I can get about task. Note that changed task will be marked as read once user jump into the task editor, so he will lose chance to review changes upfront.

Perhaps you could use an extension point in those non-IDE tools that will use simplified tooltips or use any other kind of custom rendering to keep consistent look and feel.</thetext>

    <thetext>I agree with Mik that the default task list tooltip has too much information such as the elapsed time and incoming changes that are most relevant in the task list. As Eugene points out repository information could be useful particularly for cross-repository linking although I am not aware that that is currently supported by Mylyn. 

Having a richer tooltip for the trim widget would indeed be useful as it currently does not show the bug id and the only way to obtain is to open the active task in the editor. 

How about this: Use a stripped down version of the task list tooltip in places other than the task list. It should be concise but still have sufficient additional information to justify a customized tooltip, e.g.:

 Summary
 Key, Priority [Repository]
 Owner

To me the look and feel of the tooltip is a separate issue that is best discussed on bug 205861.

    <thetext>While I think that elapsed time and scheduling info would be useful, stripped down version will be better then the current tooltip. Thought please use "key: Summary" to be able to align tooltip to the link. It would be also really nice to see reporter, project and component values if values are available.

Alternatively, may be also a good idea to have an extension point to allow 3rd party tools to contribute additional data to the tooltips, for example things like tags or external agile planning info.</thetext>

    <thetext>The patch has an unrelated refactoring that renames reminderDate to selectedDate. Could you please provide a new patch without the renaming? It is better to suggest refactorings like that instead of putting them into patches. It helps to minimize the review overhead and increases the chances of patches getting accepted.</thetext>

&gt; The patch has an unrelated refactoring that renames reminderDate to
&gt; selectedDate. 

As a thoughtful contributor to the project I feel obliged to improve code quality and that change makes it easier to understand code related to selection which is relevant to the contributed patch. Clearly private non-api field been forgotten to be renamed when date selection dialog been generalized.</thetext>

    <thetext>I appreciate the thoughtfulness and intention and agree with the technical point. As you know due to recent events I have to review your patches with additional diligence. To make that more efficient it is very likely that I will reject patches that have changes that don't directly address the corresponding bug. If you suggest improvements on the bug or add a comment in the patch, e.g. "// TODO this field should be renamed to selectedDate" I will take that into account when applying the patch.</thetext>

    <thetext>Steffen, is there much that we could really do here as the dialog is tied to the widget and if the editor is refreshed and the widget is disposed, we are out of luck.  We could at least have a guard for this and maybe a dialog informing the user that there was a problem and that they would have to reset it</thetext>

    <thetext>In 2.3, the following fields of the task form had default values (at least, when using Bugzilla):

- Resolved: "FIXED"
- Reassign to: &lt;one's own email address&gt;

Now, there are no defaults anymore. However, these defaults have been quite reasonable and very convenient and thus, should be restored. Especially, having to type one's own email address every time you assign yourself to a bug is a real pain.</thetext>

    <thetext>Please see bug 236972 regarding the Resolved field. The change to the reassign field was intentional. We considered it to be more cumbersome to erase the pre-populated email address than using content assist to quickly enter a new email address. Have you tried that?

Rob, what do you think about sorting the current user to always be the first element in the content assist proposals? Additionally we could have a small "me" icon next to the reassing field that would enter the current users email address?</thetext>

I like this idea of sorting the current user to the top since this would make it a Ctrl+SPACE+ENTER combination which is fairly fast. </thetext>

    <thetext>From bug 264581:

When creating a new Bugzilla task, I can CTRL-SPACE in the ?Assigned to:? field, which I only discovered today and which is frankly, teh axxesome.

And, I can "[x] Add self to CC"

However, I can?t ?[x] Take this bug? or ?[x] Assign to me?, which would be very handy.</thetext>

people_section

I just bootstrapped and was quite confused about the change. Besides weird looking double borders, the people icon seems to almost randomly appear/disappear.
Sometimes it seems easy to see it, drag the mouse there and click, but most of the times when I am almost there, it disappears.

Also, in a widescreen setup the field might be quite long, making it tricky to quickly move the mouse IN the textfield (since when you leave it, the icon disappears, which is annoying) towards the icon. {Almost like playing Space Quest and trying to manouver between those man-eating plant's tentacles}

Not sure if (besides the checkbox) an affordance is even needed, but I think the current implementation is not what I would want to see in an editor, from a visual and a behavioural point of view</thetext>

    <thetext>The double border is a Windows only problem. I have commited a fix that we weren't able to commit earlier because of outages at Eclipse.org. Please check if that improves the visual appearance and behavior. We can increase the timeout for hiding the icon if necessary.(In reply to comment #10)

&gt; current implementation is not what I would want to see in an editor, from a
&gt; visual and a behavioural point of view

Let's try to refine the current design to make it work properly across platforms. The enhancement is already queued for a UI review on Thursday.

I find myself frequently typing part of my bugzilla id and then using content assist to select it to reassign a bug to myself. The new icon makes reassigning a single click similar to the checkbox for adding yourself to the CC but it doesn't require another widget on the editor.

Reopening to address a problem where the background is not decorated properly when there is an incoming.</thetext>

    <thetext>I think this is a good idea but I don't agree with the proposed approach. The action should register a listener and update it's own state as the tasks may get re-scheduled through other means than the menu associated with the button. Also the patch adds a new field to a provisional class which we treat as API so this should not go into a minor release.</thetext>

    <thetext>+1 on the suggested listener approach.  In case my knowledge here is stale, where do I register the listener?

I'm not sure I agree that we can't add a new field to a class in an internal package in a service release, if that provides user value.  We may need to have a better definition of what we consider acceptable for a service release, since I'm not yet comfortable following the exact convention of Platform and only doing bug fixes, without consider UI fixes. Also, are we treating some classes, like AttributePart, as "provisional" even though they are in "internal" packages?  If so we need a convention for communicating that to contributors, even if it's only Javadoc that not all will notice.</thetext>

&gt; +1 on the suggested listener approach.  In case my knowledge here is stale,
&gt; where do I register the listener?

I couldn't find any good place to register a listener for that. Rob?

&gt; I'm not sure I agree that we can't add a new field to a class in an internal
&gt; package in a service release, if that provides user value.  We may need to have
&gt; a better definition of what we consider acceptable for a service release, since
&gt; I'm not yet comfortable following the exact convention of Platform and only
&gt; doing bug fixes, without consider UI fixes. 

Let's discuss that on an upcoming weekly call. I think we have to be very careful about UI enhancements and need to establish a process that ensures proper testing to avoid regressions. My sense is that we get a lot less usage of the service streams prior to a release particularly if the weekly site already serves builds for the next major release.

&gt; Also, are we treating some classes,
&gt; like AttributePart, as "provisional" even though they are in "internal"
&gt; packages?  If so we need a convention for communicating that to contributors,
&gt; even if it's only Javadoc that not all will notice.

No, I was only referring to classes that are actually in provisional packages, specifically CommonImages. The main problem is that if an integrator uses a newly added field there is no indication when it was added, i.e. in this case a connector using the field would fail with 3.2.0 which is not obvious. It is somewhat of a grey zone since the provisional classes are internal but it makes the commons plug-ins more difficult to consume for integrators if we don't provisional packages do not provide additional guarantees. It's probably best if we bring that up on a call as well.</thetext>

    <thetext>Now that HEAD is the Mylyn 3.3 stream I have re-committed the patch so that we get some usage on it.  We can still add the listener approach, although I've never seen an Eclipse tool item change its icon based on edits done in an editor or view.

I didn't put an @since tag on CommonImages.SCHEDULE since I'm assuming there's no need, but let me know if we should have a policy of adding those to ..internal.provisional classes.</thetext>

    <thetext>I have made the following changes:
* The action listens to scheduling changes to ensure that the icon always accurately reflects the scheduling state.
* The action is now disposed on editor close to avoid leaking the popup menu.
* The action is disabled if a task is completed.</thetext>

    <thetext>RichTextAttributeEditor installs a hyperlink presenter with hyperlink detectors that don't correspond to those installed on the AbstractTaskEditorExtension
this results in incorrect highlighting in the editor.

Ideally the RichTextAttributeEditor could discover which hyperlink detectors are installed on the SourceViewer and use those.</thetext>

&gt; David, would it make more sense to not install a hyperlink presenter and leave
&gt; it to the task editor extension to manage highlighting?

Yes, that makes a lot of sense to me.  There are some internal classes that would need to be reused or copied:

* @org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.ui.editors.AbstractHyperlinkTextPresentationManager@
* @org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.ui.editors.TaskHyperlinkTextPresentationManager@
* @org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.ui.editors.HighlightingHyperlinkTextPresentationManager@

Perhaps these could be moved to API, or should we just 'friend' org.eclipse.mylyn.wikitext.tasks.ui?

    <thetext>Would another factory method in ITasksUiFactory be sufficient or do you need to extend these classes? I would prefer that over coupling WikiText to internals to avoid strict version dependencies. It also helps us ensure the API of tasks ui is sufficient to integrate and extend it as a framework.</thetext>

    <thetext>I'm going to take a little time to review this one.  I'm not sure why we're not just using IHyperlinkPresenter and IHyperlinkPresenterExtension.   Perhaps that's what's needed here: to simplify and have the editor extension manage highlighting.

If that's the case then the main thing is that we can discover when a task is completed.  It looks like the current implementation gets a task @Task@ via the @TaskList@.  It looks like it's possible to achieve the same result via @IRepositoryModel.getTask(repository,id)@ however I have some vague recollection that it didn't work as expected.

Your thoughts?</thetext>

I think the main reason is that IRepositoryModel does not support task look-up by key. </thetext>

Perhaps it should.  It seems reasonable to me that this would be a valuable API to have... If I create a patch is there a chance that we could add to the API to support lookup by key?

    <thetext>Yes, that could certainly make sense. We'll need some more discussion about this API and also figure out how to expose the task list in the API. We should take some time early in the 3.2 release cycle to review that.</thetext>

    <thetext>The API patch looks good. Is it sufficient if we make this change for 3.2 or is it important to get this in for 3.1?

Regarding the patch for Trac, can you provide more details and an example why the change is necessary? The test cases passes even when the change is not applied. If I enter {{123}} in the web interface Trac generates a link for {123} which seems to be consistent with the current behavior of the hyperlink detector.

It can wait until 3.2

I'm glad that you asked.  It turns out that {{123}} should detect {123} as a link, but {{{123}}} should not.  We should consider that patch invalid.  My mistake.

If it is working already (and implemented) then I wonder whether this could be added to 3.1.

The main reason is that I would like to get feedback from other committers first since the patch adds API. I also strongly prefer to make API changes early in the release cycle to allow for enough time to stabilize the interface and work out any nits before it's set in stone :).</thetext>

    <thetext>(In reply to comment #24)
&gt; David, is it okay to track this on bug 280181 since this bug also describes the
&gt; API changes made for 3.2?

fine by me.</thetext>

    <thetext>Mylyn makes it possible to copy a context from one task to another.  It would be useful for third party code to be able to hook into this action.

For example, "context-driven domain diagrams":http://greensopinion.blogspot.com/2008/12/mylyn-context-driven-domain-diagram.html are data that is stored in a users workspace metadata associated with a specific task.  It would be great if the diagram data could be associated with the target Mylyn task as part of the copy context action.

Such a hook could allow for non-interactive hooks and interactive hooks that involve the UI.  Simple usage may not require interaction with the user, however in some cases it may be necessary.  In this example the hook would by default copy the diagram data with the context, however if the target task already has diagram data then the hook would prompt the user asking if it's okay to overwrite the existing diagram.</thetext>

    <thetext>Instead of asking the user a series of questions as part of cloning a task it would be nice if participants could contribute UI to the clone dialog to make all choices as part of selecting a task. We could also look at the other events in the context store and consider adding additional events to the extension point. To ensure compatibility with standalone application we probably also need a Java API to register listeners in addition to the extension point which is required to trigger class loading.</thetext>

    <thetext>A preference is to be added to enable current line highlight, default value false.  The preference should appear under *Tasks -&gt; Task Editing* in the Eclipse preferences.
WikiText task editor extension to be modified to use this preference for enabling current line highlight.

After this enhancement current line highlight will be disabled by default in the task editor when WikiText is used.
 
Enhancement based on conference call discussion.</thetext>

    <thetext>David, would you be okay with back-porting the WikiText change to 3.3.2? Otherwise I would have to revert the changes to tasks ui for the maintenance release. 

For 3.4 we could also consider making this API, e.g. adding a method to TasksUiUtil that returns whether highlighting is enabled.</thetext>

&gt; David, would you be okay with back-porting the WikiText change to 3.3.2?
&gt; Otherwise I would have to revert the changes to tasks ui for the maintenance
&gt; release.

The ugly head of CVS rises once again!  Can't the maintenance release be built off a tag?

BTW, I don't mind backporting the change.  What tag should I be using on org.eclipse.mylyn.wikitext.tasks.ui ?


&gt; For 3.4 we could also consider making this API, e.g. adding a method to

&gt; 
&gt; The ugly head of CVS rises once again!  Can't the maintenance release be built

Yes, I am planning to tag the release and to then build from that tag. It's not so much the fault of CVS that we don't branch but rather laziness of the release engineer who wants to keep the number of parallel branches that need to be maintained to a minimum...

&gt; BTW, I don't mind backporting the change.  What tag should I be using on
&gt; org.eclipse.mylyn.wikitext.tasks.ui ?

I'll have to setup a workspace and create a branch anyways so I can take care of that. I'll post the patch here so you can review.

&gt; &gt; For 3.4 we could also consider making this API, e.g. adding a method to
&gt; &gt; TasksUiUtil that returns whether highlighting is enabled.

    <thetext>Good point, Frank. I agree that CommonColors.COLOR_TASK_ACTIVE should be handled differently but I am not sure that it needs to be exposed in a preference. 

Mik, can you clarify what the purpose of the color is?

As far as I remember it is a bit lighter than black since active elements are shown bold so the color makes them stand out slightly less. Shouldn't the color be derived from another color in that case?

I have added this to next weeks meeting agenda to get feedback.</thetext>

    <thetext>We'll leave the color preference for now and review later whether it can be removed since landmarks and other bold decorations do not use this color which makes the Task List coloring slightly inconsistent with the platform.</thetext>

    <thetext>CustomTaskListDecorationDrawer direct use fields from TaskListView and not an API.

    <thetext>Thanks for posting the patch Frank. Two questions:

Why does SandboxUiPreferencePage call view.refresh()? This should already be handled by the preference listener in TaskListView.

It seems odd that focusedMode is a property of TaskListDelayedRefreshJob. Why not make that a property of CustomTaskListDecorationDrawer?</thetext>

Yes I have remove the usage of TaskListView. 
&gt; 
&gt; It seems odd that focusedMode is a property of TaskListDelayedRefreshJob. Why
&gt; not make that a property of CustomTaskListDecorationDrawer?

focusedMode is now a field in CustomTaskListDecorationDrawer</thetext>

    <thetext>This is a good refactoring and will make the gradient drawing reusable. I would like to suggest three changes:

* Remove the dependency on TaskTableLabelProvider and DelayedRefreshJob. Both of these are TaskListView concerns and should be managed there (i.e. TaskListView will also need to listen to theme changes).
* Remove dispose method and add a dispose listener to the treeViewer instead
* Rename class to GradientDrawer</thetext>

Done.

Done
&gt; * Rename class to GradientDrawer
Done, but the new Class is for GradientDrawer and CustomTaskListDecorationDrawer so do you think the name is correct.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks. From taking a quick look it seems that it would be easy to decouple GradientDrawer and CustomTaskListDecorationDrawer now. This would allow reuse of GradientDrawer in non Task List tree viewers. Would you be able to make that change?</thetext>

    <thetext>I think TaskTrimWidget needs to register a listener with the TaskList to get notified when task properties change. Something along these lines:

	private final ITaskListChangeListener TASKLIST_CHANGE_LISTENER = new ITaskListChangeListener() {

		public void containersChanged(Set&lt;TaskContainerDelta&gt; containers) {
			for (TaskContainerDelta delta : containers) {
				if (delta.getKind() == TaskContainerDelta.Kind.CONTENT &amp;&amp; delta.getElement() == activeTask) {
					update();
				}
			}
		}
	};
	
	TasksUiPlugin.getTaskList().addChangeListener(listener);</thetext>

&gt; That functionality should be available through "Open With Default Editor" from
&gt; the context menu or does that not work as expected?

It is expected that double click would open default editor. I am aware of "open with default editor" action, which requires significantly more clicks.

    <thetext>My take is that the more that we can make the attachments feel like local resources the better, but we need to be careful because they are not local resources (e.g. retrieval might take a long amount of time or require authentication).  Afaik the "Open" functionality in workbench is closely tied into the resource model, so this could be a considerable amount of work.  

+1 for considering it for post 3.0 planning.</thetext>

    <thetext>I don't see how last comment is related to the open action. It is up to the editor how to handle resources and take care of long downloads. Mylyn can register web browser as default, but user should be able to override that in a same way as any other editors in workspace. This is just a standard workspace behavior designed to reduce number of mouse clicks required for open action.

Also, in my knowledge of editor source API, editors are *not* bound to resources, so this comment is even more confusing.</thetext>

    <thetext>For FogBugz connector which I am writing, it is very unfortunate that attachments are open in web browser by default. Problem is that FogBugz connector cannot provide correct URL for attachment, because URL should contain auth. token to be correct, and this token is obtained only after connector performs login. Token also changes between logins, so URL is not stable. Therefore I generate URL without this token, which MAY or MAY NOT work, depending on whether user uses IE (or other default browser) as his browser when viewing fogbugz repository or not. If he does, auth. token is not needed as it is sent in cookie by browser.

I added custom 'Open in Default Program' command to attachment menu, which simply downloads attachment from remote repository and opens it in default program associated with attachment (not default editor). I would like to make this command as default for attachments from my connector, but it's not possible at the moment.

&gt; 

Steffen, I will have some free time in about two weeks, and I can take a look at it then.

Is there an agreement what default action should do? Should it simply use configured editor associated to the content type of the attachment, and browser as fallback?

first version of patch, unfinished

I am attaching first version of patch. It works, but needs more polishing. I am attaching it to get some feedback.

I tried to implement behaviour as suggested above, but ended up with something different. It mimicks behaviour of "Open" + "Open With" commands for standard resources. "Open With" can open attachment in browser, in-place editor, system editor or default text editor. Whichever is chosen, it is saved as 'preferred' viewer for Open command. "Open" simply uses most-preferred editor. "Open" is also default command when user double-clicks the attachment, so this effectively gives user an option to set his preferred way of viewing attachments.

Attached patch also fixes problem with current implementation of TaskAttachmentInputEditor/TaskAttachmentStorage pair. TAStorage blocks UI thread when editor is fetching data for attachment. After some playing with these two classes, I believe that attachment must be downloaded _before_ we try to call page.openEditor(). Attached patch does that (in DownloadAndOpenTaskAttachmentJob).

Attached patch is not finished. Remaining items:
* improve and externalize strings, log reporting
* get rid of TaskAttachmentInputEditor + TaskAttachmentStorage. There is one additional class using TaskAttachmentStorage -- Apply Patch action. I plan to rewrite it so that it downloads data on background thread, because currently it also blocks UI thread while downloading attachment.
* remove old "Open in Browser" and "Open in Default Editor" commands and handlers -- is this OK? This can break existing clients using these commands :-(
* testing on Linux and Mac</thetext>

Second version with patch

Changes since first version:
* attachment viewer based on default eclipse editor is preferred over the browser (this was original point of this bug)
* default attachment viewer (for double-click) is remember on per file extension basis
* downloaded file is marked as read-only ... this gives user warning when he tries to modify/save temporary file in external editor
* system-editor is always displayed in the menu. This is consistent with global Open With menu
* Open With menu is populated with all editors based on filename (again, similar to global Open With menu)
* cancelling attachment download (when opening in editor) now doesn't show error :-)
* Removed class TaskAttachmentEditorInput and TaskAttachmentStorage, replaced with FileEditorInput + FileStorage, which use temporary file with downloaded attachment content. FileEditorInput + FileStorage are not responsible for downloading anymore.
* Rewrote ApplyPatchAction to use new FileEditorInput + FileStorage. "Apply Patch" now downloads attachment first, and only then opens the Apply Patch wizard. It doesn't block UI while downloading patch anymore.
* externalized strings

Breaking changes:
* Removed "org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.ui.command.attachment.openInDefaultEditor" command from plugin.xml, and associated handler.
* Removed "org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.ui.command.attachment.openInBrowser" command and associated handler.

Both commands are replaced with Open + Open With now.

I believe the patch is finished now (modulo testing). I'll try to test it on Linux, but I don't have Mac for testing.</thetext>

    <thetext>Peter,
the 3rd patch you supplied does not work with stream based attachments, see bug#249021 that is RESOLVED WONTFIX
Also please see bug#249463 when the default editor is an external editor.

For use cases for non URL based attachments see that bug and http://eclipsophy.blogspot.com and Eventum, where URL's have the form:
http://server/eventum-2.2/download.php?cat=attachment&amp;id=1 but come from blobs.
In the data for stream based attachments the Industrial Connector can provide filename, mime type to the TaskAttachmentMapper.
So maybe a heuristic can be devised that will make a best guess based on these when no URL is present and can handle a blob based attachment.

I have submitted a TaskAttachmentPropertyTester patch some time ago, so you can test for "hasUrl" in the plugin.xml handler enablement.

The Open With Browser handler should also include that test, but that is a separate bug I think.</thetext>

Maarten, thank you very much for your feedback.

My goal was to make opening attachments work even if there is no URL. This use case works for me.

Would it be possible for you to put a breakpoint into TaskAttachmentViewersManager.getTaskAttachmentViewers(ITaskAttachment attachment) method, and see what 'viewers' (editors) are returned for your attachment?

This method is called from new OpenTaskAttachmentWithMenu class, which fills "Open With" submenu with available viewers. All of the viewers except browser-based one use stream to download attachment to local file and open internal or external (system) editor on this temporary file.

&gt; I have submitted a TaskAttachmentPropertyTester patch some time ago, so you can
&gt; test for "hasUrl" in the plugin.xml handler enablement.
&gt; 
&gt; The Open With Browser handler should also include that test, but that is a
&gt; separate bug I think.

With my patch applied, "Open with Browser" should only be visible if attachment has an url.

I also plan to get rid of attachment URLs since they cause problems in my connector too :-) so I had this goal in mind when working on this bug.</thetext>

I am little worried about the stacktrace you sent, because my patch (v3) removed "OpenTaskAttachmentInDefaultEditorHandler" class (as well as declaration of handler in plugin.xml in mylyn.tasks.ui plugin).

My patch also moved "Open With Browser" menu item into "Open With" submenu (filled by OpenTaskAttachmentWithMenu class).

In comment 11 we agreed that if there is no default editor, attachment is opened by browser. If attachment doesn't have an URL, other editors are tried too (i.e. external system editor).</thetext>

I left the browser as the default editor since browsers generally support a large number of file types and Eclipse does not have a built-in image viewer for instance.  I also added some separators to the open with menu to mirror the presentation of the package explorer's open with menu.</thetext>

    <thetext>AbstractTaskEditorPage.createPartDescriptors() uses a set to manage part contributions. It is cumbersome to add, remove or replace part descriptors form the set which is a frequent requirement for connectors. The set should wrapped in a new class which should provide the following operations:

- remove existing parts by id
- remove existing parts by path
- add a new part
- get list of parts
- get list of parts by path</thetext>

The "Unscheduled" entry shows the data "7010" in the Scheduled Task Presentation.

    <thetext>My only use case for looking at Bugzilla change notification emails is to check for recently changed bugs. It would be great if this presentation would sort my queries by modification date, showing the most recently changed tasks on top. Combined with a filter to limit the view to bugs changed in the last few hours / days / weeks that would allow very efficient lookup.</thetext>

    <thetext>Occasionally white spaces might be valid search characters (e.g. if I am searching for the word "is" but don't want "wise" to show up). Currently leading and trailing whitespaces are trimmed.

An easy fix would be to either support quotes to specify a phrase to look for, or a placeholder for a whitespace (e.g. %s)
This task could be escalated to something bigger though, to support richer search capabilities (AND/OR/phrases and even restrictions on fields to search in maybe, see task 270901). Not sure if just adding a fix for the whitspace issue here would be the best way, maybe it should be done "right" right away</thetext>

    <thetext>I like the suggestion of supporting quotes in the find field. This is very similar to how search engines and some repositories support searching for phrases. I would rather avoid adding a preference for this as most users won't ever change the default and in a lot of cases trimming of white spaces is desired, e.g. when pasting from the clipboard. 

A patch to support that would be very welcome. I don't see a straight forward way to add this as StringMatcher does not have built-in support for quotes but there might be other ways to do this.</thetext>

patch v2

Here is a simple try using quotes (and also being able to escape them). Only supports quotes around the whole search string, not a mix of quoted and unquoted.
Seems to work fine in the tests, but a little odd behaviour in the task list. What is the filtered tree searching in, just the summary? It seems sometimes I try a " string" search and some, but not all of the tasks with [string] in the beginning get filtered out.</thetext>

    <thetext>The bugzilla view shows comments in order, but quite a lot of the time when I navigate to (long) bugs, I'm more interested in what the most recent comment is, which I have to scroll down for. It would be good if the bugzilla component could have an option to show the description/comments in reverse order, so that the thing I'm most interested in looking at is at the top. (It would also be good to automatically expand the last comment in each case, too).

Whilst I realise that this might not be desirable for everyone, I'd certainly find it useful.</thetext>

    <thetext>In such a mode we would also want to put the editor on top.  This would effectively be a classic Bugzilla mode.  I always found it interesting that that nobody had asked for this yet considering that many have transitioned from to Bugzilla to Mylyn's rich editor.

Fyi, the reason we haven't done it yet is that we've been trying to optimize a single layout (that's hard enough) and in our experimentation the Actions section worked better close to both the New Comment and the most recent comment.  We can definitely consider layout options since this stuff is pretty easy to shuffle.  To date we have also shied away from providing too many options so that we get as much feedback as possible about the current UI/layout so that we can prioritize related improvements such as bug 166123.</thetext>

    <thetext>Bugzilla actually puts the editor at the top, but comments in increasing date order. I was suggesting having a view where the editor was at top (but collapsed) with the comments in decreasing date order, so looking something like:

[+] New Comment (collapsed)
[-] 2. Alex Blewitt
  I think we should put ....
[+] 1. Mik Kersten
[+] Description

This would give you the behaviour of seeing the most recent comment without any scrolling when you switch into a bug. I think having the editor at the top (unexpanded) would be mostly useless; that would mean if you switch to a view, you'd just see white space most of the time.

Do you even need the editor? You could have a 'Reply' field/button/link at the bottom of each comment (much like, say, GMail) and only show the editor as needed.

Whilst I agree that having too many options is unlikely to be great, I feel this particular mode could be very useful for others and might be worth an experiment to see how well it works. If you point me in the direction of the code (presumably, somewhere in the org.eclipse.mylar.ui.bugzlila plug-in) I could put a hacked version together to show you what I mean ...</thetext>

    <thetext>I don't think it would be a good idea to put description at the bottom (regardless of the comment sorting order). Also, changing comment sorting order won't really reduce amount of scrolling because Actions and People sections still going to be at the bottom. I think it would be more useful if bug 166123 is resolved and I also like Alex's suggestion about always expanding last comment (regardless of the incoming changes)

BTW, Alex, are you aware that Task Editor provides content for the Outline view? It might be a good idea to also have a Quick Outline (Ctrl-O) to facilitate navigation with keyboard.</thetext>

    <thetext>Is comment #3 based on anything other than your opinion? That is, do you have some kind of specific problem caused by putting the description as effectively comment 0? Even in the real Bugzilla, the description is effectivley comment 0, followed by comment 1, followed by comment 2 ... there's nothing really 'special' about the first one. What I'm suggesting is different from what has been done before, but isn't mylyn as a whole different from what's been done before anyway? Why not see if it works?

Also, note that whilst the 'actions' are at the bottom, there's no reason for them to be. I noted that it would be possible to have some kind of Gmail-like interface where clicking 'reply' brings up a text box for entry; the other options could be actions revealed at that point too.

Note also that if the last comment is expanded and in reverse order (hence at the top), then bug 166123 becomes obsolete, because it already will be where the editor is.</thetext>

    <thetext>(In reply to comment #4)
&gt; Is comment #3 based on anything other than your opinion? 

There is an opinion and there is also 2 years of experience of using the tool to deal with the bug reports. While it may seem convenient to push Description far away when commenting, it doesn't work too well for other activities. For instance, discussion in comments is often fade away from the original report and it is important to have description next to the attributes, especially when planning and triaging. So, comment zero (aka description) does have special meaning.

It seem like your suggestions are trying to address convenience of the commenting to the bug reports, but there are other activities that aren't much similar to UI interaction you could see in gmail. That is not to mention discoverability issues of the dynamically constructed UI and general layout issues in the RCP forms toolkit. I didn't say that Actions section has to be at the bottom and Mik will tel you that I've suggested number of alternative options that he had rejected.

Also note that reversed comment order and layout you are suggesting may work ok when you only need to read one last comment, but when you have dozen comments to catch up it is much more natural and faster to read them in the chronological order. Even gmail don't give you option to reverse order of emails in the stack.</thetext>

    <thetext>Why were you thinking that the attributes would need to be far away from the description? I didn't say anything about that. Reversing the order of comments/description is easily doable if the attributes are then underneath.

But look; it's clear that there's no interest in suggestions of how to do things differently, and nor any interest in trying to make it easier for other developers to help out, so rather than me prototyping a different UI for the bugzilla (which I was going to do) I'll spend my time on other projects where there is interest in my helping out.  Feel free to close this bug as invalid; I don't care about it any more.</thetext>

    <thetext>Alex, I don't see why you have to take my comments personally and discouraging. I was barely pointing out at the aspects you left aside in your proposal and simply participated into the healthy discussion.

Another thing worth to note is that most of the task editor layout details are coming from the AbstractTaskEditor, so any changes will be immediately inherited by all connectors and you need to be very careful when changing it, i.e. by design, you won't be able to change it just for Bugzilla.</thetext>

    <thetext>Alex: your comment#6 makes sense to me based on the responses that your received from Eugene.  Please note that these responses GO COMPLETELY AGAINST the communication guidelines that we have had for the project for a long time now and that have been instrumental in our success to date: http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Mylyn_Contributor_Reference#Communication  You are not the only person to be bitten by this and I have been trying repeatedly to correct this communication problem.  Please do not consider it representative of other Mylyn committers or contributors.  While I have avoided pointing to the email describing the problem because I dreaded writing it, I hope that it will demonstrate to you how important good communication is to our project and that as the project lead I will do whatever I can to ensure that it prevails: http://dev.eclipse.org/mhonarc/lists/mylar-dev/msg01351.html

Eguene: you went against what I explicitly stated in comment#1 ("We can definitely consider layout options since this stuff is pretty easy to shuffle"), you mixed implementations details reasons as justification for your opinion and what's worst of this is that you said "There is an opinion and there is also 2 years of experience of using the tool to deal with the bug reports."  To me this statement and your general tone could not be much more contradictory to our guidelines.  I won't dwell further on this on the bug report, but this HAS to change.</thetext>

&gt; Eguene: you went against what I explicitly stated in comment#1 

I didn't went against anything. Just expressed my thought and I was quite "amazed" with reaction I received on those comments. Can someone explain to me which part of comment #3 was offensive?

&gt; you mixed implementations details reasons as justification for your opinion

I wasn't aware that amount of scrolling and section expanding are the  implementation details. I've been given some of those reasons as given and barely repeated them in my comment.

&gt; and what's worst of this is that you said "There is an opinion and
&gt; there is also 2 years of experience of using the tool to deal with the bug
&gt; reports."  

Which part of that wasn't true? Also, it is of course my fault just because I said that, but have you read comment I replied to?

&gt; To me this statement and your general tone could not be much more
&gt; contradictory to our guidelines.  I won't dwell further on this on the bug
&gt; report, but this HAS to change.

Meaning what? Should I stay still when someone spill on my face?</thetext>

    <thetext>Eugene: this will be my last non-technical reply on this bug report.  Please do not act surprised because this is the same pattern as you've seen countless other times on bug reports and elsewhere and I have repeatedly brought it to your attention.  You "just expressed your opinion", it was interpreted as either dismissing, disrespectful, or insulting, and it has turned a user away.  Even if Alex's first sentence on comment#3 could be interpreted as having a harsh tone that is simply not an excuse, as I have explained before the communication guidelines are for committers, not users.  

Beyond that I have read all of Alex's comments carefully, thought they had good points that are likely to reflect the opinions of other newcommers and think that they should be considered when we prioritize this feature request.</thetext>

If you read my comment, I didn't say Alex didn't had good points. I just tried to explain that there are many angles to that issue. Also, I don't see why I can't express my opinion on some subject?</thetext>

    <thetext>Eugene: I'll consider this a final clarification of comment#12 and previous comments, although I believe that you have heard all this from me already.  You, and anyone else, can express your opinions on bug reports.  However, Mylyn committers need to be held to a much higher standard, and one that means that no matter what the opinions or individuals end result of what should be a technical discussion never results in anything remotely like comment#6.  The fact that Alex is an "insider" of the Eclipse community meant that he actually bothered to post comment#6, which I'm thankful for because was a reasonable response given the tone of this discussion and others like it.  A non-insider would have been likely to simply turn away from our project, or worse yet all of Eclipse, and tell the rest of their colleagues that while we may be building a good tool we are jerks and dismissive of newcommers' input.  Based on everything that I know about running open source project and communities that is one of the most damaging things that can happen to a community that strives to be welcoming and to tools that require the input of newcomers to become widely adopted.</thetext>

    <thetext>My vote is for allowing comments in reverse chronological order. In my view, in many cases, the most interesting comments are the most recent and in some cases, the early comments need not be read. We are in the process of creating a Mylyn plugin for Rally and in our tool, we have a discussion (same as comment) capability in which we have decided to show the most recent discussion posts on top.</thetext>

    <thetext>Mark: thanks for the feedback.  This is very closely related to one of our 3.0 plan items for improving the information density and interaction upon first open of the Task Editor.  Ideally we want all of the information that you are going to want to see and the commands you will interact with to be visible without any need for scrolling, which strongly suggests a reverse chronological ordering of the comments, as long as we can come up with something reasonable to do about the Description.</thetext>

OK, what I found until now is that TaskListInterestSorter.compare should be changed in the same way like TaskListTableSorter.compare (bug#231336)

    <thetext>It seems that TaskListInterestSorter sorts in the following order: completion state, due date, scheduled date, priority, summary. Since this is essentially a special mode of TaskListSorter I am in favor of replacing TaskListInterestSorter by TaskListSorter after bug 212967 has been resolved.

    <thetext>Thanks Frank. I am not sure that that patch addresses the problem. We still want a special sorting order when the task list is focused. 

I would like to reopen the discussion for the next release. One of the problems with the current search mode is that it displays duplicates when queries in the task list overlap. I find that that impacts the value of filtering significantly and I would like to brainstorm if we can make other improvements along with resolving this bug.</thetext>

    <thetext>My original idea was to make some spies as tools for connector developers to help display inside information, I already have a repository spy see bug 207498.
Eugene suggested using the properties view.

I use Properties View  if I want to know more about a file/resource/ui element  than is shown in the list (or hover), but less than actually opening the editor.
I think I need to give it a good think and do a simple one on the Task Repositories view.</thetext>

    <thetext>My understanding is that IPropertiesSourceObjects could be contributed by external plug-ins. This could be indeed be useful for inspection of query, task and repository objects during testing. This wouldn't have to be released but could be available from the sandbox in CVS only.</thetext>

I think generic implementations that work on the abstract classes suffice for now unless a driver comes up to extend the implementation to connector specific classes.</thetext>

org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.spy

Patch don't work when not shared project :-(

I have created a new project: org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.spy which contains the IPropertySource adapters for AbstractTaks, TaskRepository, RepositoryQuery and TaskCategory plus MylynPropertiesSourceFactory to create them.
There is startup code to register the factory and adapters on startup, so they work immediately.
Also included is a Repository Spy view where you can also DELETE properties.</thetext>

    <thetext>Patch applied.  Great stuff Maarten!  Should we now get rid of the IntrospectObjectACtion and inline some of what it does into the Properties pages?  The only real functionality that will be missing is provided by the Plug-in Spy, which we can also contribute to if needed.

After getting some mileage on this we can consider moving in to mylyn.tasks.ui, since it doesn't necessarily get in the way.  But I still see the main use cases as developer and not end user oriented.</thetext>

    <thetext>The main problem I see with moving it into tasks.ui is that some of the properties on TaskRepository are connector specific and it is not clear how to present them. This could end up being more confusing than helpful to a user. 

+1 for contributing to plug-in spy in favor of introspect actions</thetext>

    <thetext>Agreed.

Maarten: you added an early startup extension to the plug-in.  I removed this because it's generally a problematic policy to start things eagerly.  Also, it wasn't working because the plug-in did not implement IStartup.  Also, I applied this patch in too much of a rush and should have given you more feedback on the Eclipse conventions that we adhere to for naming.  I have updated the patch to these conventions, so please review them for future reference.  Also note that I added the Repository Spy view to the Mylyn Sandbox category.</thetext>

OK, your the lead ;-)
My reason for adding it is I found that the properties weren't showing at first if the plugin wasn't started, as the factory wasn't started yet. So a click in any Mylyn view did not show anything in the properties view. I had to open the Repository Spy view to get the properties to work.

BTW, Is there an update manager URL for the compiled sandbox feature?</thetext>

&gt; OK, your the lead ;-)

This is unrelated to my being a lead, it's an Eclipse convention that we follow, and those are always up for debate if needed.  My job as lead is to arbitrate when such debates come to a stalemate :)  And to ensure consistency in our decisions and design aesthetics.

Is this still the case?  Note that it never would have worked because the plug-in did not implement IStartup, which is a requirement for early start.

Yup, it's on the extras: http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/downloads/</thetext>

Mik probably meant "experimental" update site (not the same as "extras" update site), which can be found under "Archives and other builds" link from Mylyn download page. Direct url for that update site is http://download.eclipse.org/tools/mylyn/update/weekly/experimental  </thetext>

    <thetext>I have a few 'heavy' bugzilla queries. I look at them from time to time. Mylyn synchronizes those heavy queries quite often. This causes unnecessary load on the bugzilla server. I would  prefer to synchronize some queries on demand. There seems no obvious way to exclude some queries from automatic synchronization.</thetext>

    <thetext>Michael: note that the performance of query synchronization grows is dominated more by the number of tasks in your Task List that have changed on the server, and less by the size of the queries.  This is because we synchronize all changed tasks.  As such, I'm not sure that this control would provide you with the effect that you're after.  Is the problem that you're seeing the bugs.eclipse.org synchronization take too long?  We have other ideas for optimizing that.</thetext>

    <thetext>While synchronizing the number of query results is not as much of an issue with Bugzilla it can consume significant bandwidth for other repositories such as JIRA which transfers all details for each queried bug. The CPU and memory overhead imposed on the repository by a complicated query can also be significant. 

Shawn and I had a quick discussed for a simple UI: A new sub-menu could be added to the context menu of a query with following items:

 Synchronization Priority -&gt;
  Default (every time)
  Low (once a day)
  -
  Do not Synchronize

    <thetext>As a user I would prefer to have control on the synchronization intervals and submenu with hardcoded intervals don't provide enough flexibility. Team VCS synchronization have special UI for configuring scheduled synchronization, so maybe it would be better to have something similar in query configuration UI.</thetext>

&gt; The idea was to set it per query.

Afaik for Bugzilla query time is more likely to be dominated by the incremental synchronization of all tasks then the synchronization time of all queries.  As such I'm not sure that this would address Michael's problem, since the 'heaviness' is not likely to come from the queries themselves.    

Before exposing more implementation details of synchronization to users I think that we need to identify the bottlenecks and see what we can do to remove them.  I created bug 215100 for that discussion.</thetext>

    <thetext>Another side effect of the automatic synchronization is that I get all those popups that notify me that an entry has changed in my 'heavy' query. I am only interested in immediate notifications of changes of my more specific queries. I want to synchronize the 'heavy' query on demand.....

But maybe this is a very specific requirement and it might be more confusing than helpful.....</thetext>

    <thetext>That sounds close to another use-case: For planning I occasionally run a bunch of searches (e.g. open Mylyn 2.3 bugs / open JIRA bugs / open API bugs) . The search dialog only remembers the last query requiring me to renter each search. To avoid that I have added most queries to my task list but that causes extraneous synchronization and notifications. 

We have been bouncing the idea to resurrect an old Mylyn Bugzilla feature to allowed to save searches and have UI to quickly run them. Would that also help with your use-case?</thetext>

    <thetext>I would also prefer a static set of queries in a task list (or in worst case some other view) then a search view. It would be also handy to be able to clone Task List view (bug 151432), use different presentations and "go into" and then quickly jump between particular views, which would be more flexible then single working set.</thetext>

&gt; Lowering priority since we have implemented considerably query synchronization
&gt; improvements that should address some of the performance problems.

Are this improvements released in 2.3?
AFAICS problem still exists in 2.3. I've a lot of "low-priority" queries, and they requires too much time to update.</thetext>

&gt; Unless we have clear indication that this will improve real performance, not
&gt; just perceived performance, I don't think we should have it scheduled.
&gt; 

Certain queries do cause high load on Bugzilla servers such as those that use some of the advanced query capabilities requiring fields that are not indexed together.  In those cases, it's not up to the user to fix the indexing (and it may not be practical to do so).  I often see issues with queries that use advanced search options like changed in the past n days and/or look for text in the comments.

These types of queries can really hammer a Bugzilla server if the data set is reasonably large (i.e. 50K bugs).

BEO has a number of these types of queries that become problematic as I've seen.  At times, MyLyn would ask BEO for too much data causing my IP to become blocked due to the sheer volume of data being transmitted back to me.

    <thetext>I am using Mylyn quite heavily with a lot of queries in different repositories grouped by working sets:

*  10 working sets
*  12 repositories:
**  Local
**  Bugzilla: Eclipse, Tasktop
**  JIRA: Codehaus, QuickFIX/J
**  Trac: Local test, Mylyn test, company Admin+Development
**  Web: GlassFish + Glassfish Plugins (IssueZilla), legacy company tracker
*  about 50 queries, most of them (35) for my local company Trac

Scheduled updates therefore put a heavy burden on my Eclipse VM so that I reduced the rate to once
every hour.

But this does not fit my needs:

*  Schedule rate should be configurable
**  per repository
**  per query (inherit from repository)
**  per working set (overrule queries/repositories in working set)

The best would be to be able to schedule this like for UNIX cron jobs. Then I could e.g. say

*  Mylyn queries at every full hour afternoon
*  Subversive queries 5 minutes past noon
*  Local company stuff: never at full hour, but every 10 minutes

Together with this also the notifications should be configurable, e.g. enable per repository, query, working set.

Focusing on a working set could also prevent some scheduled updates or suppress notifications.

I am sure this task should be broken down into sub-tasks...

As a first step I would like to see a configuration per repository.

A UNIX cron job style configuration would also be very flexible but could be used as an implementation idea
instead presenting this to the average user.

    <thetext>Voted on this issue since I regard is as a major impact of Mylyns usability.

Would prefer a first implementation, e.g. per-repository synchronize jobs which are separately cancellable
and configurable as a sub-task.

    <thetext>Kevin, Jorg: We plan to take a pass on query performance for the Eclipse Galileo-based Mylyn 3.2.  However, note from my comment#1 that our sync time is generally dominated by the number of changed tasks that have to be retrieved, and not by the time to run the queries themselves.  If we were able to read a feed of changed tasks, it would speed up dramatically and this problem might not manifest itself in a vislble way.

That said, I like your suggestion of putting the configuration on the repository settings.  That's a lot less complicated than on the queries.  Also, it enables users and potentially templates to specify slow intervals for the large OSS repositories (e.g., Eclipse, Mozilla), and a fast interval for smaller company-internal repositories (e.g., 10min).

In our case, the number is not so high, but the server is slow :-(

&gt; company-internal repositories (e.g., 10min).

This sounds good as a start.

Further, it would be a good idea to have working sets to modify this behaviour:
All repos/queries in a working set are queried more often than these in the others.

Are you able to provide a first solution quickly?

If there is a background job per repository, I could cancel it by hand if it takes to long. So splitting the
synchronize job into several ones per repo would also help in the very first place.

Thanks, Jörg

    <thetext>Jörg: You are starting to convince me.  While I still think that we should avoid allowing queries to have their own synchronization schedule, it might not be that bad to allow synchronization to be disabled per-query, as long as we have some kind of visual indicator that it's disabled (e.g., an overlay on the query node, and a tooltip that mentions auto synch is disabled).

* Decorate those queries with a different repository icon (I'll provide that, related to "disconnected" repositories)</thetext>

    <thetext>I have added a "Synchronize Automatically" check box to the task list menu. The check box is enabled by default. If unchecked a query is not updated unless forcefully synchronized or if a synchronization of all queries is forced. 

The icon currently uses the gray style if a query is excluded from automatic synchronization but that may need improvement.

    <thetext>Should be able to automatically create a query in the task list based on the last executed Task Search. Perhaps we could contribute a button to the search results view.   First iteration might just be to add a button to the Task Search page that will create a query based on the currently selected parameters (last executed query).</thetext>

    <thetext>Hmm. Why not from the popup menu in a search view?

Also, it would be really convenient to be able to edit the search criteria when refreshing the search results. I often find that I need to adjust criteria, and now these adjustments are polluting history of the Search view.</thetext>

    <thetext>I found a problem which I can't resolve. The problem is the search results removing.
These results are stored in the QueryManager object which is non-public. So I can't use it.
The InternalSearchUi.removeQuery() method not only remove it, but it stop the running query too.
So I have some ideas, which is the best.
1. Remove the last search result from the history before I start the new search. This has one disadvantage, if the user cancel the new search I can't restore the last search result.
2. After the new search start I observe the search running (with a while loop inside a Thread.sleep()). After it will be finished I will remove the last search.
3. Write a request that modify the QueryManager to public. I think this will be the best, but I don't know, that will be solvable.
What do you think about these ideas?</thetext>

    <thetext>Great work Balazs!  This will make it into the New &amp; Noteworthy.

Please synch up and note the changes that I made to AddTaskListAction, now called CreateQueryFromSearchAction.  The structure that you set up was perfect, I just changed the way that the image is retrieved and the wording in the UI.  

I also added a way to add individual hits to the Task List, so check that out.  It will help keep the UI simple for bug 193423.</thetext>

    <thetext>For the commit informations in the TableViewer I need the class "GenericTaskChangesetMapper.java", 
which gets me the whole needed data for the viewer. 

Currently is my whole code located in the plugin o.e.m.tasks.ui, but from there I can't access the code from GenericTaskChangesetMapper. It is possible to access the plugin "o.e.m.versions.tasks.mapper.generic" from o.e.m.tasks.ui ??

Or I have to move my code to the plugin: org.eclipse.mylyn.versions.tasks.mapper.generic ??</thetext>

    <thetext>We should discuss the best location for a generic task mapping and potential cache to retain that information. Since we want to leverage the information within Tasks it seems that we need to provide some framework in o.e.m.tasks for tracking task related information such as change sets. I wouldn't want to limit the cache to change sets but we could use that as a driver for the initial version of the API.</thetext>

    <thetext>In my opinion we have 3 different options:
1. stay the code in o.e.m.tasks.ui (problems with dependencies)
2. move to code to o.e.m.versions (limited to change sets)
3. create new bundles for the activity part (sounds good to me)</thetext>

&gt; /org.eclipse.mylyn.versions.tasks.mapper.generic/src/org/eclipse/mylyn/versions/tasks/mapper/generic/GenericTaskChangesetMapper.java

Is this a demo implementation or a really released functionality? If the second one, then, where I can find this feature in the task editor?</thetext>

Okay right, I have the "tab" in my task editor, but the tab is always empty.

Yes I think so too, and I have both things in my workspace.

    <thetext>Steffen was right: It lists all changes of the repositories in the workspace, which are associated with  the task repository of the task. Since it parses the changesets in the history of the repository it only works well with distributed version control systems like git. 

One possibility would be, that the changeset is not recognized as associated with that task. Currently we detect it, if the task key or the url is in the commit message, so any of these should work:
#378002
Bug-id: 378002

Yes that's right and it works. I have used it false in my Eclipse. 

For the data in the TableViewer (tab: Changeset) following steps are needed: 
1. activate task 
2. change files 
3. commit the changes 
--&gt; after these steps I see the data in the TableViewer

At the moment I get from the changeset object the autor, date, message, id BUT not the changed files. 
This list is always empty: TaskChangeSet.getChangeset().getChanges() [return: List&lt;Change&gt;] is at the moment empty. 

What I have to do, to see the changed files?</thetext>

    <thetext>Since I'm retrieving the whole history of the repository I did not want to fetch that changes eager. 
The api of ChangeSet is not optimal, since it requires the changes at construction, with no possibility of lazy loading. I've created bug 380584 for changing the api.
For this feature however, it might be better to cache the data locally in an index, so only the relevant ChangeSet objects are constructed.
I'll look into this this weekend.</thetext>

    <thetext>Not exactly sure if I should be adding this suggestion here or as part of bug 190359, but it might be nice to see the Owner of a task in the description and/or hover popup for those people who use a task like to monitor the task of their team members.  It was suggestion in bug 204020 that I add this suggestion here.  Please let me know if you would like me to move it to 190359.

    <thetext>Mike: are you thinking of having something like this?

  123: this is a task [mik.kersten@eclipse.org]
  
Or a real name if available?  I could certainly see the case for that.  Personally I would prefer to see the Reporter than the owner because my queries are organized by owner, but it's a very similar use case.</thetext>

&gt; What if we made a Preferences -&gt; Mylyn -&gt; Team style template for having users
&gt; author their own label decorations?

I'd be a big fan of this.  Your comment number 5 and eu's comment number 6 really illustrate the issue perfectly.  You create queries and organize them by Owner and want to see the reporter.  He creates queries and organizes them by whatever and wants to see the target release.  I create queries by target release and want to see the owner.  A customizable template seems like the way to go.  Should be (relatively) simple since you already have something similar for the Commit Comment.</thetext>

    <thetext>+1.  I'm raising priority because of the good arguments in comment#9 and other comments on this bug, as well as the general feedback that it would be nice to see additional column style information in the Task List, but also general lack of agreement of what that information should be.  The one thing that will be a bit tricky is how these decorations overlap with the tooltip.  (Eugene: the fact that this course in the UI is obvious to your or I does not mean it is obvious to all interested).

Note that with the current architecture we will be limited to the common task schema for decorations (e.g. owner) because those are the only ones that are kept in memory (connector-specific Attributes like Milestone are read from disk on demand and cannot currently be used for decorations in this way).  However, adding this will help push us on providing access to the additional attributes (related to bug 170681).</thetext>

    <thetext>Mik, are you working on this one or just grabbed it, so no one else would take it?

I suggest to add new preference page that would allow to configure the following (current layout is shown on the right):

Category - ${label}
Query - ${label} [${repositoryLabel}]
Group - ${label}
Scheduled group - ${label}
Task - node in the task list - ${taskKey}: ${label}
Task (external) - ${label} 

The last one is used for synchronize view and in task history and trim dropdowns

Suggested variables: label, taskKey, repositoryType, repositoryLabel, repositoryUrl, completedCount, incompletedCount, totalCount</thetext>

    <thetext>This needs to wait on other P1s and P2s.  But I think that integrating it should be pretty straightforward after that, as long as we are happy with having a global option along the lines of "Include task Ley/ID in labels" instead of making that decorator-based.</thetext>

&gt; as long as we are happy with having a
&gt; global option along the lines of "Include task Ley/ID in labels" instead of
&gt; making that decorator-based.

The use case against global option was if someone want to have decoration like {taskKey}: {label} {repositoryLable} for the change sets in Synchronize view. Though it is slightly artificial</thetext>

    <thetext>Eugene: I couldn't tell whether you were OK, with my proposal in comment#16.  If you are than I think that we can proceed.  Regarding the Synchronize View nodes, as mentioned on the call they need to be treated differently and I think that they should have a special rule.  This is in part because their decorations will need to work differently, I'm not sure if they support decorations contributions, and their current labels are used as part of the commit comment.  But do consider filing another bug since I think it would be useful to show the repository label for them.

Given that consideration, the iteration on your design is as follows:

1) Put the Label Decorations page under the Task List page.  This won't be final and I'll iterate with upcoming prefs pages, either by turning the "Task List" page into a "Tasks" page or by adding a "Presentation" section to that page.

2) Remove the ability to make the key part of the label via this facility, since that will be provided independently and with special handling via bug 190359.

3) Make the decoration apply wherever Tasks are visible (I think this is already done).  The main view this will affect is Search.

4) Each proposal will need a test.

5) You may need to remove the "repositoryType" parameter if exposes implementation detail, because for some connectors the kinds are not user readable.  Also, since these decorations will accept different object types in a way that's strongly typed, so I wondered if they need to be prefixed by type like the team ones, e.g. task.url, query.completedCount.  I actually don't like this idea because there is considerably polymorphism with the kinds.  But I am concerned about "completedCount" showing up for tasks and not being useful (could be for subtasks), or the user not knowing whether or not it will show up for tasks.  This could be addressed with a special rule for that decoration, as long as it is not computationally intensive (i.e. doesn't walk subtasks).  Please outline the full set of proposals that you plan to implement, noting whether the do or don't apply to some Task List elements.  I think that the set you have is good so I don't think we'll need to iterate much on this.</thetext>

    <thetext> (In reply to comment #19)
&gt; Eugene: I couldn't tell whether you were OK, with my proposal in comment#16.  

I am unclear what implication it will have. So, I propose to have an unified API underneath, but UI would have checkbox that could simply construct appropriate decoration template and that is what will be saved in the preferences.

&gt; If you are than I think that we can proceed.  Regarding the Synchronize View nodes,
&gt; as mentioned on the call they need to be treated differently and I think that
&gt; they should have a special rule.  

That is exactly why I asked you to reiterate on this

&gt; 2) Remove the ability to make the key part of the label via this facility, since
&gt; that will be provided independently and with special handling via bug 190359.

That defeats the purpose of this issue.

The filtering issues you've mentioned, should be addressed somehow different, i.e. filtering by key should use the real task object and not the visible label. You would have to do this anyways when implementing 

Also, this issue is not really about decoration, but about what label will be visible. One of the ideas I had was to allow an alternative "Summary" field that will strip all [foo] tags (those could be shown in the tooltip, in icon decoration, or at the end of the summary, using separate template) 

&gt; 3) Make the decoration apply wherever Tasks are visible (I think this is already
&gt; done).  The main view this will affect is Search.

Not sure what this mean.

&gt; 4) Each proposal will need a test.

Do you want decoration implemented as a lable provider, or somehow different? If the latter please provide some pointers.

&gt; 5) You may need to remove the "repositoryType" parameter if exposes
&gt; implementation detail, because for some connectors the kinds are not user
&gt; readable.  

That is "type" user will see in the "New repository" wizard. How can it not be human readable?

&gt; But I am concerned about "completedCount" showing up for tasks and not being useful
&gt; (could be for subtasks), 

The more we deal with the subtasks, the more I feel they are bad idea. Besides, it was you who was initially against any kind of hierarchy in the task list.</thetext>

    <thetext>My request from #263676 bug:

from team manager point of view it would be great productivity enhancement if a
Mylyn tasklist could be configured to show ticket owner next to it's
identifier. Preferably - with a visual hint on whenever this task is accepted
(in TRAC notation) or not. Together with an option to sort results of a query
based on ownership we could get a powerfull tool to track team progress in a
current iteration.

It could allow me to setup queries for tasks for each of my weekly iterations
(marked as milestones) and see my teem progress like this

Week 23
  34 [nickA] : this task is completed and stroke through (when filter is turned
off)
  35 [nickA] : this task is in bold, as it's the task currently accepted by
team-member and he's working on it
  36 [nickA] : next task in a queue - sorted by priority within the group of
all not completed tasks
  37 [nickA] : next task etc.
  38 [nickB] : this task is completed and stroke through (when filter is turned
off)
  39 [nickB] : this task is in bold, as it's the task currently accepted by
team-member and he's working on it
  40 [nickB] : next task in a queue - sorted by priority within the group of
all not completed tasks
  41 [nickB] : next task etc.

Task list UI could even provide additional level of task grouping (with
collapse/expand functionality) based on ownership information...

    <thetext>Wojtek: The Task List view's primary intention is intended for day-to-day work, not team management, and we have deliberately put project management type features out of scope of the Mylyn project.  As such, we would need either community resources to take ownership of the contribution or mainteanace of such a feature.  Alternatively, you can file this as an enhacement request to Tasktop, an extension of Mylyn that intends to provide project management features.  The only other option I can think of is that someone contribute a lightweight mechanism for adding decorations to tasks in the Task List that provide this.  The challenge with that is that the labels can look quite noisy, so I'm not sure if they would be a good surrogate for a project management style table view.</thetext>

So basically it means that you don't have a man-power to extend Mylyn scope more into team-management area? That's unfortunate... It seems that mylyn idea of task management needs just a bit of UI enhancement (configurable ways of displaying tickets returned by a query) to become extremely powerful agile management tool... I've looked through tasktop website and it seems that it's more elaborate, but still rather personal-oriented, not teamwork-focused...

Thanks anyway for the answer.</thetext>

What it means is that the Tasktop team that's contributing to Mylyn has to have a clear line between the open source and closed source portions of the tool.  Planning, time tracking, and management features are things we have made closed source.  If there were other community or vendor resources interested in contributing such features to Mylyn we could revisit.  That said, you can always bug us about making simple UI enhancements that are inline with our project scope but that provide more flexibility, such as some kind of decoration mechanism for labels, and we will prioritize that against other open enhancement requests.

Regarding the Tasktop feature set, yes, the current Tasktop Pro is still mostly developer-focused.  But you can get on the early access program to get a preview of some of the upcoming management and planning specific functionality.</thetext>

Actual there is no way to add new variables. But if you think we need this is possible that we use some kind of callback for support connector specific variable.

The templates are configurable from an preference page and based on the kind of the object in the tasklist. Do you want connetor specific defaults in the preference page?</thetext>

    <thetext>Frank, on today's call we briefly discussed how to unify this label capability with what is already available in the commit template facility.  There appears to be a lot of similarity between the two features seeing as how both are intended to expose attributes of ITask and both require extensibility (which is already implemented for the commit templates). So ideally we'd base the task list labels on the same commit template variable infrastructure/extension point.  Thoughts?

In terms of UI, Mik suggested that configuring labels/commit templates could then function similarly  to what is found on Eclipse  &gt; Preferences &gt; Team &gt; Cvs &gt; Label Decorations' text decoration tab.  The pages would have a similar task list preview so users can get a sense for what the selected labels will look like.</thetext>

    <thetext>Very cool Frank! Here's my first brain dump on this patch:

* There is a small change to SynchronizeQueriesJob. Could you explain the need for this change?  Just remove it for now (assuming unrelated) and if you could create a new bug with details regarding the problem it was intended to address that would be great.

* Tasklist Preference page
** Adding a variable from the  "Add Variable..." pick list currently double wraps the variable name with {}   i.e.   {{containerTotal}} 
** Should the pick list be scoped to variables that apply to the target type?  I.e. Should only variables that can be derived from a task be available in the "Add Variable..." dialog when setting up task decorations?

* Further to Shawn's point in comment#62. Looking at the code in TaskElementLabelProvider.getText() for example, I see opportunity to simplify while making labels extensible. I see a repeat of this manual translation/mapping appearing in TaskElementStyledLabelProvider as well.   If variables and their translation was encapsulated in a class similar to CommitTemplateVariable (variables registered via org.eclipse.mylyn.team.ui.commitTemplates) then in all these instances it would be an iteration over the contributed TemplateVariables which would return the appropriate value given a task/category/query/changeset. Would you be able to take a look at what would be involved in evolving the CommitTemplateVariable into a genericised TemplateVariable class that could be contributed through an extension point and consumed by both commit templates and task list decoration?</thetext>

    <thetext>One thing that we discussed on the call today is that we want to limit configuration to decorations and leave the actual label provider untouched initially. Concerns were raised that making labels template based would slow down rendering of the task list since the labels are computed on the UI thread whereas decorations are calculated lazily on a background thread.

On a side note, it would be awesome if we could consider bug 222429 as part of this effort and use colored label decorations in the Task List.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks for the screenshots Frank. I plan on reviewing the patch in more detail next week. On a first glance it seems that there is some potential for generalizing the template implementation in TaskLabelDecorator. 

On the last call we discussed the configuration UI for the templates and the general consensus was that your first proposal (Preferences_Text_Decoration.tiff) with a single field per item is preferable to the expandable sections that have separate fields for prefix and postfix. 

I am not sure how much work it is to revert back to the old UI. If you prefer I can review the patch first and make suggestions and then we can iterate over the details.</thetext>

Sam,

I have recreate the patch to recall what we have implement.

All entries of the Task List can have custom format.
By example you can configure a task to show not only the summary. You can add the following variable as a prefix or suffix and include literals. The configuration is done in a preference page.

    <thetext>It seems like most of that information is already shown in the task list (e.g. synchronization state is indicated by an icon, completion state by an icon and strikethrough), so I'm not sure there would be much benefit to adding labels. One of the commenters wanted to see target milestone, but that would require being able to add arbitrary task attributes which we should not add to ITask for performance reasons.

If anyone still wants this label functionality, please comment.</thetext>

    <thetext>The part I really though was interesting is what is illustrated by attachment 151986 (screenshot (115.19 KB, image/tiff) 2009-11-11 16:20 EST, Frank Becker)

The real added value is for projects which do not really use the "Id".
Then, you can change the displayed label of the task to better fit to your project's needs.


For example :

I am using GForge, and Mylyn with the generic Web Templates connector.
Hence, the id must absolutely be the programmatic id, which we see in the URL (otherwise, the Web Templates connector simply can't recover the details).

The point is my project is not using at all this id, but instead use a custom GForge attribute named "Reference" to identify each task, like "DMC/FT/2".
(more specifically, the integer value of the field "Reference", prefixed by the name of the project and "/FT/")
In mails, documents, each task is only refered to with this "Reference", and no one cares about the GForge id.

So printing the id first in the label, only pollutes the HMI for my project's users. Ideally, they would prefer to use the custom "Reference" attribute instead, but if that is not possible, any other information is still more relevant for them, including the Description alone.


Please, tell me if I need to add screenshots from GForge and Mylyn to better illustrate my case.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks for the info. I don't think screenshots are necessary, you described it very well. What your asking for sounds like it might make more sense as a feature of the web templates connector. I would expect any other connector to use meaningful task IDs.</thetext>

    <thetext>Well, the task IDs are meaningful for a GForge projet :
- it is well visible from GForge,
- it is used in the URL, ...

The ID is just not meaningfull considering the project's particular practices.
So this is exactly the same as if, in the bugzilla, you were considering that the "199345" ID is not meaningful, but prefering using a per projet extra number field, and use instead something like "Mylyn-9956". This way, you could talk to a client who does not care about other Eclipse projects and wishes to focus on the Mylyn bugs only.

So the problem could happen with any connector. Not just the Web Templates one.

We may consider that this is the project's practices which should evolve to consider the real ID, intead of this custom 'reference' field. But we all know how difficult it is to change users' practices.</thetext>

&gt; I see. You are right, supporting custom IDs could make sense for any
&gt; connector. Frank, does your change support that?

No, actual are only fields from interface ITask and IRepositoryElement are legal for Tasks.

Actual all implementations from ITask are subclasses of AbstractTask so we maybe can use AbstractTask.setAttribute(String key, String value) to set an new key for this case. But then we make sure that all AbstractRepositoryConnector.updateTaskFromTaskData(TaskRepository repository, ITask task, TaskData taskData) set this new key.</thetext>

&gt; Are you thinking of changing the actual task id or just changing what is
&gt; shown in the task list?

No I think we should add a new attribute key "customID" and add this to the possible variables for a prefix/suffix of an task.

The name must be a setting in the TaskRepositorySettingPage and is stored in the TaskRepository.

If one TaskRepository did not support this key ew replace this with an empty String.

    <thetext>Makes sense for me (though I have not dived into the Mylyn code). There is no point in changing the actual programatic id, since it is still needed for programmatic issues, even if not displayed to the end user.

We are trying to make the label better looking, but we can't make miracles if there is no way to recover the specified attribute considering the connector's implementation.</thetext>

    <thetext>So users would have to enter the attribute id in the repository settings? This doesn't sound like a very general solution. For example, what if different projects on the same repository use different attributes to store the ID? I'm not sure there's a good way to support this.</thetext>

    <bug_when>2007-03-18 21:38:54 -0400</bug_when>
    <thetext>Some applications need to inform the user of events in the workbench that may require attention, whether or not the workbench is visible.  An increasingly standard way of doing this is to use a desktop notification popup, often appearing for a fixed amount of time in the bottom-right hand of the window.  As an example, Mylar has a custom notification mechanism to inform the user when a Bugzilla report has a new comment.

Ideally this mechanism would use the native platform mechanism for notifications.  But as far as I know the common case is that this isn't available (for Linux/GTK see http://www.galago-project.org/specs/notification/index.php).  I don't think that we should wait on native ones to become reusable because we already have the case where multiple Eclipse-based applications are showing custom notifications with different look-and-feel (e.g. the IBM Jazz demo at EclipseCon 2007 showed custom notifications that would clash with Mylar's).  To avoid these UI clashes and having other plug-ins implement their own support, it would be helpful to have Platform/UI provide an SWT-based implementation.

UI stuff to figure out:
* Appearance: slide in from bottom (MSN Messenger), slide in from left (Jazz), fade in/out (Outlook 2007).  I find the latter best because it is noticeable but not distracting.  
* Multiple notifications: tile or show next/prev button (Messenger, Jazz demo at EclipseCon), show sequentially (Outlook 2007), merge into 1 and elide (Mylar, Outlook 2007 in some cases).  I find tiling problematic because it's hard and stressful to aim for popups when more than one is present.  The next/prev button can be stressful to interact with because it is hard to aim for small buttons in the limited time that the notification is visible (even though the popups typically stick when mouse is over them).  For this reason on Mylar we will show up to 3 notification in a single window and provide an "n more..." hyperlink.
* How much information to show.  I think less is best because the notifications are necessarily small which makes them hard to interact with, so the view or editor that they take you to should make the incoming information clear.  The notifications should present the minimal amount information for the user to decide whether they want to handle the interruption.

In conjunction I think that we should come up with a first pass at UI guidelines describing when to use which kind of notification mechanism (status line vs. system tray vs. desktop notification).  Microsoft has a similar guideline, but it's a bit thin on when to use the desktop notification mechanism.  See http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/UxGuide/UXGuide/Controls/Notifications/Notifications.asp</thetext>

    <thetext>The SWT SystemTray would be the default - are you just suggesting this for an guidelines update?

If there are missing supports than we should get an emulated one for SWT - do you have a bug to reference for this?</thetext>

    <thetext>Tod: if I'm understanding you correctly, you're suggesting that we use the SWT system tray support for desktop notifications described here.  The proposal here is that "desktop notifications" be available in addition to system tray notifications.  They serve a different role, as demonstrated by the fact that apps including Mylar, RSS Owl and Jazz feel the need to use them (in addition to all the other apps that use their own, such as Thunderbird and Google Desktop).  Microsoft Outlook is a pretty good example of what kind of info is good to have in system tray balloons vs. in desktop notifications:
* System tray balloons: show status messages that need to show when the app's status bar is not visible (e.g. connection state changed, data file verified)
* Desktop notifications: show incoming email messages, have additional buttons that allow message to be opened, flagged, and deleted</thetext>

    <thetext>The System Tray is the only thing the platform provides currently. If you think there should be a reusable one for all applications to use if someone wanted to contribute one in a standalone plug-in I think this would be a big asset to the community.</thetext>

    <thetext>We can certainly contribute Mylar's desktop notifications and make sure that they are flexible enough for others to easily contribute to and improve.  I think that they would need to be internal until others were successfully reusing them.  I also want to make sure that once they are contributed them Mylar uses the Platform version so that we don't end up with forked implementations.  Which leads to a couple of questions:

1) Where should they be contributed to?  First to the Platform Incubator, or straight to Platform?

2) What's the right timing for such a contribution?  After Europa goes out?   </thetext>

    <thetext>Mylyn can contribute our popup widget for 3l.4 so please feel free to assign to me.  We plan on slickifying both the presentation and the drawing of the widget in the near future.  Please note that the widget itself is only 1/2 the story since the notification mechanism also has to be easy to use, contribute too and customize.  So we would need to make sure that we had others' requirements for that, to collaborate, or to make sure that we don't get in the way in the presence of custom notification mechanisms.</thetext>

    <thetext>Fyi, I just added the new SWT alpha fading for shells for these notifications popups, and it works beautifully.  As discussed on our notifications call I think that the Microsoft Outlook style of fading notification popups in and out works best in terms of both getting the user's attention and not being abnoxious.  To go through the 255 alpha values we're currently using a sleep of 80 and an increment of 15.  That's definitely a notch slower than what Outlook uses but it appears to work well.  We'll be iterating on those values along with upcoming improvements.</thetext>

Notification popup in RSSOwl 2

FYI we just overhauled our notifier in RSSOwl. The title area uses the same gradient UI forms is providing and adapts to the used theme thereby. Just wanted to give some ideas about what could later become a workbench-leveled thing :).

Btw, yes we will definitively make use of setAlpha as well. Thanks for the details on the values you used Mik.</thetext>

Ben, what are those "pin" icons on the right? I find it strange to show 5 entries and say that there are 15 changed. Jazz popups, that you can find on the UI working group wiki pages, have neat pagination to look trough those.

I certainly like rssowl header more then the weird one used by Mylyn, though both of them are redundant.

I still believe that more lightweight popup would be better. For example only show number of tasks and a hyperlink to the task list (maybe also switch Task List into the "incoming" presentation).</thetext>

Yeah, dont worry too much about the content. Its independent from the general notification idea here. The idea in RSSOwl is that you can mark certain news (or notifications) as sticky and then dismiss the notification. Later you can easily come back to those sticky notifications (since they are rendered in a eye-catching fashion in the UI). That allows to somewhat remember certain news without the need of restoring the entire application (and thereby interrupting whatever work you are doing meanwhile).

&gt; I find it strange to show 5
&gt; entries and say that there are 15 changed. 

Yes, the popup is far from being finished. We will offer buttons to navigate to all notifications that are stacked behind. An alternative presentation could be to show the full content of a notification. Then one would step from notification to notification.

&gt; Jazz popups, that you can find on
&gt; the UI working group wiki pages, have neat pagination to look trough those.

Yes, thats basically it.

&gt;

&gt; I still believe that more lightweight popup would be better. For example only
&gt; show number of tasks and a hyperlink to the task list (maybe also switch Task
&gt; List into the "incoming" presentation).
&gt; 

I like the approach of what we do now, because it makes it very obvious which application is showing the notification. TB goes into a similar direction. Their notification popup does show even a larger icon of Thunderbird.</thetext>

&gt; &gt; TB goes into a similar direction.
&gt; &gt; Their notification popup does show even a larger icon of Thunderbird.

&gt; Yuck! You don't have to take in any bad example you can find around. :-)

Yes I agree its a bit too much, thats why we chose a solution that still informs the user about the application providing news and not giving that info at all. Btw our current solution goes into a direction of what skype is using.</thetext>

&gt; I like the approach of what we do now, because it makes it very obvious which
&gt; application is showing the notification. TB goes into a similar direction. Their
&gt; notification popup does show even a larger icon of Thunderbird.

Yes, for better or worse application specific branding is important in popups, because they are too hard to distinguish, especially if we end up with similarly colored Forms looking ones that come from different applications.  While Thunderbird's is definitely on the too-loud side, Microsoft Outlook does a good job of this with its much more subtle email icon, e.g.: http://www.brentozar.com/buyingtime/Outlook2003/TrayNotification.gif  Mylyn has always used the prefix "Mylyn Notification" to make this explicit without using an icon, but that's way too subtle.  

Ben: I really like what you've done with the visual style of the popup header and border.  Do you want to collaborate on merging what you've done with the contribution that Mylyn is planning on making to Platform?  We've got some different interaction rules (e.g. max 4 items show, all are hyperlinked), but we don't necessarily need to standardize on those, since we could make the layout of the area below the title configurable by clients.</thetext>

Outlooks solution is interesting because it also provides affordance to drag the popup to a different location. Having a small view-dropdown-like thingy top right was something I thought about too.

Yes I think we only have to agree on the visual look of the popup outside the content area since that could be contributed (maybe have a default that works with links). I am not yet sure where to show the controls for navigating in the stack of notifications. Will comment back here once I found a solution. The problem with adding more controls is that the popup becomes more and more heavyweight which is something I dont like very much.

Could you attach a screenshot of what Mylyn currently uses as notification popup?

We can consider this after the next round of design.  As usual my hope is to minimize end-user configurability unless we fail to come up with a suitable UI that meets the average user's needs.

I am in favor of almost the exact design that you have.  The only changes I think would help are:

* Image: should support a 16x16.  Looks like you have a 24x24, but for the Mylyn or standard Eclispe tooltip I think that this is best to be the shell's image at 16x16 (the 32x32 is likely to be too distracting because apps like to have visiually bold icons). 

* Title text: +1 for bold, but since it is bold I would prefer to have the standard form title color (blue in your theme) because bold black is too intense, and the title does not need to stand out that much.

* Buttons: I like the single close button.  Seems fine to have a pull-down for prefs, e.g. to take the user to the corresponding notifications prefs page. 

I wonder if the easiest way to proceed is for you to submit a patch of just the tooltip popup with some kind of abstract class for showing contents?  I could then add our fading and other stuff and and we could iterate.

&gt; Could you attach a screenshot of what Mylyn currently uses as notification popup?

Attachment follows. Ignoring the header the design is as follows:

  [decoration] [decoration] [icon] [hyperlinked label that opens the item]
  [1 or 2 line textual summary of the change]

A maximum of 4 items will show.  If there are multiple incoming items then a hyperlink shows up summarizing the number of other changes (note that in the attachment I removed the third incoming change).  Clicking the link takes you to the view whose job it is to show you the incoming changes (in Mylyn's case the Task List).  </thetext>

&gt; The lower-right hand of the screen has become a de facto standardized 
&gt; on for desktop notifications.  

That is not quite correct. On Windows, the de facto standard is the next to the trim bar (or what that thing where all the apps dumps their notification icons to). I.e. notification is shown in the bottom-left corner if taskbar is on the left vertical edge of the screen, etc.

Also, most of the notifications also leave some marker on a trim bar, which Mylyn currently lack of, and that introduces a usability issue, because user can't postpone switching to the place he got notification about (I suggested to add support for that during UI working group conf call about notifications).

&gt; Also, the multi-monitor implications are weird for laptop users.

Don't forget the screen savers and other full screen applications (i.e. video players). Last time I've used Mylyn's popups they don't respect full screen mode at all.</thetext>

Btw, the close button was taken from Firefox. I guess it would be better to get some UI from the eclipse team instead (it should not differ much from the existing one imho).

&gt; I wonder if the easiest way to proceed is for you to submit a patch of just the

Yeah I might be able to hack something over the next days and will submit it here. The only thing I am not sure about is using UI forms for this. I extracted those parts from forms that deal with creating the colors to avoid a dependency. That said, for RCP developers like me it would be good if the popup could be used without adding any dependency.

Thanks. What do you think about providing a solution for the navigation inside multiple notifications? I find it hard to get it right without making the popup look too heavy (maybe Kimberly could help out here with a suggestion?). So far I had these ideas:

- Show two arrow buttons in the title area of the popup
- Show buttons inside the content area (e.g. on the right hand side) to move up and down inside the notifications

I think providing this by default helps a lot of developers that have to deal with this case where notifications get hidden because of the actual number of items.

Perhaps marker isn't a good word. It is an icon that tells that there is something haven't been looked at. I.e. TB shows it together with the notification and you can click on it after notification popup is dismissed. Purpose of that is obvious (imho).</thetext>

Things became more interesting in Eclipse Workbench. In that particular case using icons in the tray may not be a good idea, also note that things notified about are not necessary visible, i.e. Error Log, Syncronize or Task List views may not be visible, so the idea is to show notification icons in the Eclipse status bar.</thetext>

We're agreed here, so let's take it off the table for now.
 
&gt; It would be great to get some UI for the pull down. For now we could try using
&gt; the view dropdown icon (maybe a bit smaller). The pull down would only show if
&gt; he creator of the popup would fill actions into a menu manager for instance.

I think that an editor/view "x" for close works.  It matches nicely with the rounded corner style that you have chosen and is standard.  It is faint but in my opinion that is a benefit.
 
&gt; Yeah I might be able to hack something over the next days and will submit it

Unless there is are concrete use case for not having the Forms dependency, I think that it's better to do it with the dependency, because then it's guaranteed to evolve with forms, not allocate more colors, etc.  For Mylyn this is a non-issue because we depend on forms.  For the popup I figure that until there are RCP developers complaining that they don't want the Forms dependency it's fine to have (perhaps there are some already?).  It's easy enough to pull out after.

Kimberly and I chatted a bunch about this on the Eclipse UI call.  While I agree that there is a use case, I find that interacting with a dialog this small, beyond clicking a hyperlink or button, is way too cumbersome.  I see these popups as entry points to a view that better supports interaction, such as determining what all the new stuff that came in is.  So while it seems fine for the dialog to be extensible to notification navigation, for Mylyn I would definitely like to leave it out.  But it seems that making it optional should be reasonably straightforward.  The question is whether the navigation contributes to the header (e.g. prev/next arrows) or to the body (e.g. scrollbar-style metaphor), but either way the dialog can be extensible to that.</thetext>

I think the close button is fine in the workbench but I am not a big fan of using it in the popup (yes, I think its ugly...also note that Jazz seems to use a different icon too). We should leave API to override the close button then?

When using ColorDescriptor the colors should not be allocated more than once (not sure how forms is allocating the colors). Having a dependency to forms is a no-go for us (yet, we are not using forms anywhere. we might in the future but thats undecided). I can still provide the code for the platform to use, but we will most likely stay with our solution. In the spirit of a small and leightweight RCP 4.0 I really try to avoid dependencies where possible.

I think it really depends on the kind of application. At least in RSSOwl the user is usually running the application over the entire day (e.g. at work). So, he could be involved in something completely different when a notification comes in. He might just be interested in getting an overview without restoring the application (I would call that a context switch which interrupts his work). Also, some users might be interested in reading the description of a notification. Thereby the popup would only show 1 item and navigational buttons would be a mandatory requirement.

&gt; &gt; Unless there is are concrete use case for not having the Forms dependency, I
&gt; &gt; think that it's better to do it with the dependency, because then it's
&gt; &gt; guaranteed to evolve with forms, not allocate more colors, etc.  
&gt; &gt; For Mylyn this is a non-issue because we depend on forms.  For the popup I 
&gt; &gt; figure that until there are RCP developers complaining that they don't want 
&gt; &gt; the Forms dependency it's fine to have (perhaps there are some already?).
&gt; &gt; It's easy enough to pull out after.
&gt; 
&gt; When using ColorDescriptor the colors should not be allocated more than once
&gt; (not sure how forms is allocating the colors). Having a dependency to forms is
&gt; a no-go for us (yet, we are not using forms anywhere. we might in the future
&gt; but thats undecided). I can still provide the code for the platform to use, but
&gt; we will most likely stay with our solution. In the spirit of a small and
&gt; leightweight RCP 4.0 I really try to avoid dependencies where possible.
&gt; 


I'd really like to second Ben here. I would love to see something like that in RCP. But from my point of view, RCP is already too large for small apps (Like RssOwl). So another dependency would be a no-go for me as well. </thetext>

    <thetext>+1, this would be useful to ECF and other Eclipse projects... plus everyone else building on Eclipse.

How about something in the Eclipse incubator to prototype something... it seems like most of the code is there (from Mylyn) and a desire from contributors to make this happen.</thetext>

    <thetext>It sounds like we have converged enough on the design of the popup itself in order to proceed.
* The popup title and style will use your rendering and a small icon on the left for application branding.  It will not be coupled to Forms.
* The notification item area will be fully customizable, at least for now.
* The close button and prev/next navigation will be optional (e.g. on for RSSOwl's heavier use of popup content, off for Mylyn's very light use of content)

Here's how I propose we proceed:
1) Ben: you attach an initial versoin of your popup that does not provide any contents or lifecycle support.  E.g., an abstract class with a dummy concretization that placeholder contents.
2) I merge this with Mylyn's current popup support.
3) We iterate, and then figure out whether we should generalize the notification's lifecycle mechanism, prefs, etc.
3) We figure out the best and most generic place that we can put this for 3.4.</thetext>

    <thetext>If a generic API for popup notification is created, it would be great if it supports Growl on MacOS. Almost every OSX applications use it for notification. This would be a perfect desktop integration on this platform.

    <thetext>I'd second the growl. in fact, I think it would be good to separate out the UI display from a general mechanism handling notifications, which might have properties associated with them (such as whether the notification requires user input, or whether it should fade out after X seconds). An event queue could then drip-feed these notifications to the display mechanism, which might be the system tray or a different style of pop-up.

The proposal as it stands seems to be too heavily focused on a single UI way of showing notifications.

PS +1 for Growl, which basically allows apps to fire events and then have them queued for display by a separate mechanism.</thetext>

&gt; Mik, can you please give me a clue why do you think that persistent notification
&gt; indicator is not needed? See my previous comments for some more details.

Eugene: This is out of the scope of this bug, which is focused on making a nice looking and useful popup appear and disappear according to its clients needs, in a way that parallels other popups of this sort (which don't have this sort of trim indicator).  Please file a new bug for this suggestion.  In case others are interested in this see Eugene's comment#22.

Regarding Growl, I agree.  Although the actual extension to Growl will need to come from a plug-in that's external to Eclipse, since Growl is not a standard part of MacOS.  While this bug is about the popup itself, I do hope that we make progress on a generic notification mechanism (as per comment#35).  Nicolas: since you were the first to suggested it, I please file a new bug report for this.  The notification mechanism is currently part of Mylyn, but we're willing to work on it as part of related improvements, and if/when it gets generalized it would come along with the extension point. For now it's probably best to file the bug against Mylyn in order to get cycles on it.

Ben: thanks for the prototype, will review and report back.</thetext>

    <thetext>This is extremely interesting and well-timed.  We are planning on adding some kind of notification to our Eclipse-based application.  We were just going to do an ugly pop-up dialog, but desktop notification would be much more sophisticated.  Are you planning this for 3.4?  I sure hope so.  I don't really know what I can contribute except for my enthusiasm that you will provide a way for the rest of us to do this, too.  Hurray for you!

    <thetext>We now have a generic desktop notificiation popup and some progress on a generic notification mechanism, and Ben's cool rendering of the shell.  The popup itself now handles the following, each of which can be customized:

* Display: Currently this fades in and out of view (if on supported OS and Eclipse 3.4).  If the user mouses over the popup won't disappear.  Once the user mouses out popup will disappear/fade.

* Positioning: whereas we previously positioned on the same monitor as the workbench was in, we now always position on the primary monitor since that seems to be more common (see bug 213978).

* Rendering: We grab the parent shell's icon for the notification icon and use Platform.getProduct().getName() to generate the title.  This means that if you have an RCP product called FooApp with its own icon, the notification will have the same icon (helping the user associate it to the app) and will say "FooApp Notification".

Next steps:

* We'll move this into a new plug-in that can be reused without depending on other parts of Mylyn, so that others can try it out.  We can then iterate on the API and figure out the best home once it has been hardened.  Bug 214379 is currently driving the creation of the new plug-in.

* We consider generalizing the notification mechanism and contents.  The Task List notifications have some useful functionality that others could want to reuse (e.g. overview link, detail, button for dismissing).  

* We iterate on the visual design.  

Ben: shall we iterate around making this work for RSSOwl, or are you planning on keeping those notifications separate for the time being?</thetext>

    <thetext>Great work Mik! Regarding iteration: I don't think we will move over to using Eclipse 3.4 soon enough to already integrate the generic notification mechanism. Let me know when the plugin is available and I will check if there is anything left to align RSSOwl's current solution and the generic one.

&gt; popups are sexy

They also can be annoying at times. Personally I'd prefer something more permanent, like "incoming" or "new mail" indicator somewhere in "tray" area. This way I am not forced to read popup before it fades away forever and can read all incoming changes at more convenient time, hence less distraction.

    <thetext>Scott: I discussed this with Ben at EcipseCon and we figure that the best we could do for 3.4 is to have a generic bundle in Mylyn, with no non-RCP dependencies, that others can consume this from (as per my comments on bug 214379).  We can't commit to making this API because, as far as I know, we don't yet have any clients of it other than Mylyn and the test app that Ben contributed.  So here's how I figure we should proceed.  Mylyn will provide the bundle and it will have popup and notification mechanism, consumable independently (e.g. just the popup with your own notification mechanism, or the notification mechanism with Growl popups).  The classes will need to be in an internal/provisional package because this would enable us to move them to the beast API home in the course of the next coordinated release (e.g. to Platform/UI).  This is a slight problem for Mylyn because for 3.0 we were planning on not having any plug-ins consume our other plug-ins' internals, but I don't see a better choice.  Let me know if something else would make it easier for ECF to consume.

Ben: fyi, we have made the popups fade back in if they are partially faded out and the user mouses over them.  I was wondering if we should give the shell a shadow, because it tends to blend into white backgrounds (e.g. Eclipse views).  Let me know if there is any reason why you didn't have a shadow in your original.</thetext>

Yeah I can see this being a good addition at least when the popup shows over white background as in your case. I think for RSSOwl the popup would usually show when the application is minimized. Could you attach an image of how the border would look like for the popup?</thetext>

    <thetext>We have created org.eclipse.mylyn.commons.ui, which provides common UI facilities including the desktop popups: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn_Integrator_Reference#Commons_API  

The plug-in's only dependencies are org.eclipse.ui and org.eclipse.core.runtime.  Since we don't yet know of any clients other than Mylyn's Task List, and since the popups might eventually find a better home in Platform UI, they are in an "..internal.provisional.." package.  We will be happy to evolve this implementation based on integrators' needs and contributions.  One thing that I could imagine integrators wanting us to generalize from the Task List is the notification management.  Once that's done we could make the notification UI itself get specified by extension point, making it possible to bridge to other notification UIs like Growl (bug 209911) or Jazz.

The core implementation is done, so I'll move this bug to Mylyn.  For anyone consuming the popups, please open new bugs against Mylyn.  If someone would like to see the popups move from Mylyn to Platform for Eclipse 3.5 I suggest filing a bug against Platform UI and CC'ing me so that we can discuss how and when to start doing that. </thetext>

    <thetext>Jazz is very interested in Platform API for 3.5 and we would like to give some more detail on our needs in this area. We already have a mechanism to separate the core (sending out a notification) from the ui (showing the notification). Both are extensible and easy to use. I will post the details of our solution to bug 209911 because it seems the discussion on separating core/ui will go on in that defect. 

Please invite me to the planning call or send me a note so that we can coordinate.</thetext>

    <thetext>Currently, there is one regexp which has to return ${task.id} in the first match and ${task.description}
in the second one. This could be made more flexible in this way:

1. Any regexp is allowed with any number of capturing groups (...)
2. Any capturing group can be referenced by e.g. ${query.group.1}...
3. For both the task id and the task description a string composed of any characters and references to variables
     including the capturing groups ${query.group.1}... can be build (form input field)

E.g.

	Task ID: "ID ${query.group.2}"
	Task Description: "${query.group.3}: ${query.group.1}"

In this way, access to other task properties (e.g. status, priority etc.) could be defined.</thetext>

&gt; Finally someone asked for that! :-)

Eugene, actually I have this idea for months now, but it is the first time I posted it.

In the beginning, I was thinking about some sort of JDBC connector, because our
self-made issue database is based on PostgreSQL and has a very simple web frontend.

IMHO, this would also make the implementation of bug 189788: [web connector] Allow more task properties to be set using fixed mappings
much easier.

    <thetext>Joerg, as a first step I'd like to make a suggestion about regular expression syntax.

We already using ${varName} to substitute variables. So, it may make sense to use something like (${varName}) to declare parsing group.
Then you can replace all (${varName}) into (.+?) before compiling regexp and also keep map of those variables to group numbers. Then you can use that map after parsing to map groups back to names. This way we won't need any special UI and can also easily specify what variables are allowed there. So, potential field candidates are (based on the present Mylar's object model - AbstractRepositoryTask): 

task.id
task.summary
task.isCompleted
task.status
task.priority
task.kind
task.owner
task.reporter
task.creationDate
task.completionDate
task.dueDate

Thanks for the context. This was a great helped. I was looking for the connector inside org.eclipse.mylar.web.*...

&gt; syntax.
&gt; We already using ${varName} to substitute variables. So, it may make sense to
&gt; use something like (${varName}) to declare parsing group. [...]

There must be some misunderstanding. Looking at WebRepositoryConnector.performQuery
I would like to change the following:

- Allow any number of matching groups (matcher.groupCount()) -- even nothing found???
- Assign every matcher,group(n) to ${query.group.n} variable

How can I assign a new ${...} variable?

OK, now I got it. But this is less flexible: I cannot e.g. assign

  task.summary := FIXED TEXT ${query.group.2} FIXED_TEXT ${query.group.1} ...

I admit that you have to provide a UI field for every task.* attribute with predefined default value.
But your suggestion sounds a bit unhandy and introduces a complex syntax.

    <thetext>I am not convinced that it is a good idea to introduce such scripting/templating/remapping for individual fields. You should be able to extract id, summary, etc as is and fixed text can only came from the web page. Syntax that I am suggesting look better to me, because you can see which field it will be mapped to right away, and that is an improvement to the current regexps. For comparison, query.group.x won't mean anything inside query and like you noticed, it will require additional UI to deal with that.

Also note that we should not allow configurations that can't return task.id and task.summary. So, those two fields are mandatory.</thetext>

That means you are making assumptions about the format of the web interface.
IMHO, this is far too restrictive for a generic web interface. In our case, we are in control
of our web interface so we could make the web interface fit the web connectors assumptions.
But is this the right way to go?

    <thetext>Actually, on a second thought I take it back. We need phyton-like syntax [1]. Expression would look like &lt;td .+?&gt;({task.id}issue[A-Z]\d+)&lt;/td&gt;  Then you can just cut variable in {} off the (..) declaration and like before run regular regexp and then match mapping back. 
Note that it should handle case like \({aaa}, when {aaa} is not a variable since one "(" is masked with "\".

Do you intend to add this library to the web connector plugin? This would be the simplest way.

Or is this too difficult and creates too many dependencies?

    <thetext>The Eclipse IP review process means that we have to carefully select dependencies that we want to request adding, and the dependencies that we do request need to be under a compatible license (e.g. EPL or APL).  So it is probably worth exploring an approach other than adding [1], since that would take 6 weeks after the Europa release minimum.</thetext>

We could in theory, but it is not feasible from the practical point of view for reasons Mik explained. So, I think it is the best to build it around standard Java regexps. Like I described before, remove vars from regexp string, but keep map of wars to regexp groups (that part is probably is most complicated and it can be done outside of Eclipse and should have some unit tests), then you can use that map to match parsed groups with variables.</thetext>

    <thetext>OK, I did not think about the IP process. Actually, it is not too difficult to implement.
The matching groups are counted by the opening parenthesis, I have to avoid "\(" as Eugene said
and map the group number of every "({id}" to the id.

But at the other side I am still worried about the increased complexity of the regexp.
Splitting the task attribute generaton into a matching step and a assembling step would support
more scenarios.

E.g. we have the fields category and title in our issue database. I would like to join the in the summary:

    category: title
    
I cannot do that with the current regexps.

In summary, the _generic_ web connector should be as generic as possible.

I disagree on that. It should be simple enough to use and too much flexibility and hard to use UI is not necessarily a good thing.
However you should be able to build your own extensions on top of generic web connector.</thetext>

You also have to watch for the nested groups and make sure that they are accounted in the same way as Java regexp does, also (?...) groups aren't captured. Still not relatively straightforward. See http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#cg</thetext>

&gt; I disagree on that. It should be simple enough to use and too much flexibility

In this specific case, just another GUI element like the ParameterEditor would be sufficient.

&gt; However you should be able to build your own extensions on top of generic web
&gt; connector.

Sure. But then I would not like to call it "generic", rather "example."

Anyway, I will try to implement some regexp syntax as you suggested.

&gt; &gt; The matching groups are counted by the opening parenthesis, I have to avoid
&gt; "\("
&gt; &gt; as Eugene said and map the group number of every "({id}" to the id.
&gt; You also have to watch for the nested groups and make sure that they are
&gt; accounted in the same way as Java regexp does,

They are counted by opening parentheses, e.g.

   ...({a}({b}({c}...)...)...)
   
is assigned as

   a:= $1; b:= $2; c:= $3

&gt; also (?...) groups aren't
&gt; captured.

Good point.

&gt; Still not relatively straightforward. See
&gt; http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#cg

I may also have a look at the JRegexp implementation to get some hints.

    <thetext>OK, will implement some utility class including unit test first.

Please advise where the utility class and the associated unit test should live.
I have no idea of your package conventions.

Thanks, Jörg

    <thetext>I've implemented NamedPattern wrapper, hooked it into query parser and updated few packaged templates to fetch assignee and status. Current implementation is hardcoded to guess status by one of the common words: completed fixed resolved invalid verified deleted closed. More advanced way to detect completed task is discussed on bug 194496.

This fix adds support for named regexps using syntax like ({name}.+?). Current implementation recognize group names: Id, Description, Owner, Type and Status. Other fields of the AbstractTask need either value substitution or customizable date formats and will have to be handled on bug 189788

Anyways, I think it is a big improvement. Now it can retrieve assignee and status (so no need to manually manage completed status).</thetext>

Actually we use "done" here, could you add this to the hardcoded status guess?

    <thetext>Currently socket timeout been set to 10 seconds and http request timeout - to 30.  This changed with the bug located a https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=174685.

These values should be configurable for each repository.

I was using eclipse 3.2 with the latest version of mylar for that release with a web based repo and it was working fine.  I moved to 3.3M6 this week with the dev build of Mylar and I always get the  "Unable to fetch resource: Read timed out" error message when mylar queries the web repo.</thetext>

    <thetext>Mylyn currently uses a timeout of 60s for connections which seems sufficient to me. We could consider to increase the socket timeout to 180 s (currently 60s as well). Cancellation has been implemented for Trac and JIRA so a higher default timeout should at least not affect usability too much once this also works for Bugzilla.

    <thetext>Basic description:

XPlanner has an actual time setting in a task, that is currently allowed to be set in the XPlanner Mylyn connector using a single edit field.  Since Mylyn has a mechanism for automatically tracking time spent working on a task, it should be possible to use that mechanism to automatically (or manually) update the actual time setting for an XPlanner task. 
This implementation could then be extended to something that could possibly be used by other Mylyn connectors.

First thoughts for synchronization with Mylyn planning:

1.  (probably obvious) If a connector supports estimated time/actual time
settings, the Connector implementation should set these in Mylyn's planning for
the task when the Mylyn task is first created for the connector task -- or if
the connector supports only start/finish dates, these should be coordinated
also.

2.  I think there should be a checkbox in the editor (again, if time tracking
is applicable to the connector) that would indicate whether the user wants
actual time to be tracked by Mylyn automatically and set in the connector task,
or whether the user will do it themselves manually -- using settings on the
custom editor page for the connector -- big brother would be an option.

3.  In XPlanner's case, as I mentioned, time is traced using time records that
can be added multiple times until the task is finished.  I am not sure how
other systems track time, but I imagine, as you said also, some use a records
implementation, and others have just a set "actual time" setting that can be
modified.  I am not sure whether it's worth actually displaying the time
sections in record format on the custom editor page, since it would already be
available in the planning page, and I don't think it's worth duplicating data. 
I think actual time should just automatically be updated (if user chooses
option suggested in #2 above) and saved when the task is written back into the
connector repository.</thetext>

    <thetext>Summary of discussion on latest mylyn call:

1.  It is probably not a good idea to have Mylyn automatically store actual time spent on a task back into the actual tracking system, since first of all it would not allow the user to participate in fixing any inaccuracies, and second is actually not desired or even allowed in some work environments.

2.  Implementation should include an edit field showing Mylyn's current actual time in the connector editor page, and a button for propagating that information into the actual tracking system.  The user will be able to edit this time to accurately reflect what they want to store.

3.  There should probably be a read-only field displaying the current total time already stored in the actual tracking system for this task, so the user can see exactly what they are updating.

4.  After saving the time in the actual tracking system, the edit field will reset to Mylyn's current tracked time.

5.  There should probably be some way to differentiate whether the time to be saved should be added to or replace the time in the task in the actual tracking system -- maybe a checkbox saying "add to/replace"?

6.  To start with, a rough implementation should be made in the XPlanner connector first, and then we can review whether/how it applies to other connectors.

Please feel free to add anything I have missed from the call...

    <thetext>Helen: summary looks great.  As per point (6), Bugzilla-specific presentation of this, and the general UI are out of the scope of this bug, and as discussed during the meeting we can iterate on that with a common UI once we have rudimentary XPlanner UI in place.</thetext>

    <thetext>(Copying Robert's comments from duplicate bug #196695 -- sorry for the confusion)
&gt;&gt; I am not sure whether it would be best for the tracked time on the
&gt;&gt; XPlanner edit page to be using its own timer, or to be synchronized
&gt;&gt; with the "refresh" button result on the planning page. 

We need to make sure the timing being reported to XPlanner comes from the
global mylyn time tracking facility and not its own timer. If functionality is
missing in mylyn then just create a bug report and we'll work on adding it
together.   

&gt;&gt; 3.  If the tracking is to be synchronized with the refresh button on
&gt;&gt; the planning page, I will need some kind of listener notification so
&gt;&gt; that I can know the time has been refreshed.

Yes, the time on both the planning page and in the XPlanner editor would both
ideally be updated via a listener and the refresh button eliminated. This
should probably work via the existing ITaskActivityListener interface and the
AbstractRepositoryTaskEditor could implement this. Unfortunately we can't
change that interface since it is public. But something along these lines
should be done so just let me know what priority this is and I can investigate
further.</thetext>

    <thetext>Robert, thanks for your comments.
I didn't mean that the XPlanner page should have its own time tracking timer, just whether I should have a timer that updates the text on the page with Mylyn's current tracked time -- or whether the Refresh button should trigger the update instead of the timer.  You answered this, though, with your second point -- if there is a listener that directly connects to the time tracking, that would be best.
This is, I am sure, not very high priority in the overall scheme of Mylyn things, but is just what I think I am supposed to be working on among my XPlanner bugs, since it might affect Mylyn API as a result.  </thetext>

    <thetext>Good question.  I assume the Mylyn tracked time is from the beginning of first time task activation, so just showing that, obviously would show the total time.  I think I might need to keep track of time since last submission myself, in addition to the total time.  Maybe I can display both, and the user can have a choice of which value they would like to use.  If this is the case, probably the "add" option on the time should only be available if the "time since last submission" value is selected.</thetext>

    <thetext>Okay so really you will handle presentation and all you need is to get the timing update notifications.  We could create a new interface like so:

/**
 * @API-3.0 merge with ITaskActivityListener and turn into an abstract class
 */
public interface ITaskActivityListener2 extends ITaskActivityListener {
	
	public abstract void taskTimeUpdated(AbstractTask task);
	
} 

and you implement and register one of these in the constructor of your xplanner editor.  THen within teh taskTimeUpdated method you could update your timing widgets and I could do the same for the planning editor.  Then I just need to wire up the TaskActivityManager to fire these events.</thetext>

    <thetext>Helen, I've created ITaskTimingListener interface and for now you can use via TaskListManager's addTimingListener() and removeTimingListener(). Behind these methods the listener is registered with TaskActivityManager which is currently internal. This will need to change for 3.0.  I've made use of this interface for the TaskPlanningEditor and committed this so you can see this for an example use of this new interface. If you come across any problems or would like to see more timing related information exposed via this interface, let me know and we can iterate on this.</thetext>

    <thetext>Hi Markus.

I am hoping to do this by the end of this week -- sorry -- I've been a little out of commission for a while.  
Just out of curiosity -- is it specifically the actual time update coordinated with Mylyn's time tracking that you're missing, or just being able to set the actual time?  (because you can just set an actual time value for the task currently).  Also, this implies that you would be willing to pick up dev builds, since this feature will only be available in the next official Mylyn release (2.3, I believe) at the soonest.

Thanks a lot for your interest

    <thetext>Hi Helen,

dev builds wouldn't be the problem. What we need is at least to be able to enter the time spend on a task exactly like in XPlanner (xplanner/do/edit/time).
What would perfectly satisfy our needs is that every time you active a task it automaticaly inserts the start time in xplanner (may be with a setting that allows to round up to 15 ,30 or 60 minutes) and when deactivating it inserting the end time (also with the round up). Manuell editing should still be possible though.
Something like this would be great.

Markus</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks for your reply, Markus.  
I believe, actually, what we were planning was to coordinate Mylyn's tracked time with the time that would be saved in XPlanner, but we weren't going to automatically update it for you -- you would still have to make sure the time you see on the XPlanner editor page would be the time you want to save in XPlanner, and then use the "submit" button to save it in the XPlanner repository yourself.  
The idea was that if we try to do it automatically, it would be too big-brotherly, and many people would not want (or some places even legally allow) that kind of automatic time stamping getting recorded.  
Would the manual submit of tracked time still be ok for you?

    <thetext>Hi Helen,
manually submitting it would be fine as long as the start and stop time will be generated automatically (may be with a setting that
allows to round up to 15 ,30 or 60 minutes) in eclipse, so that maybe I can click on "submit" right away without the need to change anything.

I think the rounding option should be doable.  I do however have to change my too hopefully given completion estimate to end of next week, since it turns out I have a lot of other work I need to finish in the next few days.  If you have any other ideas, please add them to this bug report.
Thank you very much for your suggestions and interest in this connector.

Patch for first pass at using Mylyn's time tracking in XPlanner connector

This patch adds a new section to the actions section of the editor.
This new section gives the user the choice to use Mylyn's time tracking for storing in the XPlanner task's actual time setting.  This
is done via a checkbox.  Additionally there are controls to round the value to the nearest half hour, and radiobuttons to allow the
user to either add Mylyn's tracked time to the current repository actual time, or to replace it (the actual setting in the repository will
only change when the "submit" button is pressed).
The "Add" choice is useful if the Mylyn task is activated on a repository (XPlanner) task that already has some actual time in it.  The "Replace"
choice is useful if the repository task starts out with no actual time.
The defaults are:
-- Not using mylyn's time tracking
-- Rounding to nearest half hour (half hour is the only thing that made sense, since XPlanner only allows one decimal point digit as part of its settings)
-- Adding time to current repository setting.
If any of these are changed, they are persisted for the next time the editor is opened on any XPlanner task.
Selecting any of these, immediately updates the "actual time" setting in the Mylyn XPlanner editor, and additionally uses the Mylyn tracking timer for the update (immediate update is so that user can see result right away on selection, instead of waiting for next applicable time tick).
Ability for user to update the time manually to whatever value they choose is still remaining.  However, if the "update automatically" checkbox is on, with each relevant time tick, that value will be updated with the result of the above selections.</thetext>

    <thetext>This looks great Helen! Patch applied, ip log updated. Depending on how often it is a user will want to change the rounding and whether or not to replace or increment the value on the repository, you may be able to fold away these extras.  I haven't see it done before but one interesting way of doing this might be to use an expandable composite with no title and set the check button as its text client, making what would appear as an expandable check box. </thetext>

    <thetext>Sure.  I think this should do it:

-----------------
The XPlanner connector now allows using Mylyn's automatic time tracking to be 
incorporated in the actual time setting for an XPlanner task.

The XPlanner Task editor actions section has a checkbox that allows the user to turn automatic time tracking on or off (default is off).  There are also options for allowing the automatically tracked time to be added to or replace the current actual time (default is adding -- actual update is done when the Submit button is pressed), and rounding the automatically tracked time to the nearest half hour (default is to round).
The user still has the option of putting in actual time manually, however, if automatic actual time tracking is enabled, the last entered user value will be overridden with the latest tracked time.
------------------

Let me know if this is not sufficient.

Thanks a lot
-Helen

Patch for checkbox as expansion control for "auto tracking" section

This patch follows Robert's suggestion and sets the control for the expandable section to be the checkbox that controls whether the
time should be autotracked by Mylyn.  This is just a UI change, really -- the section gets automatically expanded if the editor is opened
with the "auto tracking" setting "on".</thetext>

    <thetext>I reran the XPlanner tests a few times after merging in all your checked in changes, and they all passed.  I also ran them as part of all the mylyn tests, and they still passed.  If you see tests failing again, could you let me know which tests failed and the failure output?

Thanks</thetext>

    <thetext>XPlannerRepositoryConnector does not seem to implement postSynchronization(). Where is the repository synchronization time stamp that is used in preSynchronization() updated? The was previously handled by the default implementation but needs to be implemented in connectors now.

XPlannerRepositoryConnector does not implement getTaskRelations() which replaces AbstractTaskDataHandler.getSubTaskIds. It is used to build up the task list hierarchy. The Jira connector implementation is probably a good example.

There is a e.printStackTrace() in addUserStoryTasks(). Should that exception be propagated instead?

In XPlannerRepositoryConnector.performQuery() I replaced the first argument of the Status constructor in the catch block from IStatus.OK by IStatus.ERROR. Please review that is okay.

I have removed some of the commented out code and added a few TODO comments. It would be great if you could take a look at those.</thetext>

    <thetext>Thanks! Here are a few notes:

* It's great that you created static accessors for all the custom attributes on IRepositoryQuery and ITask. I think the calls to Integer.valueOf() in XPlannerTaskListMigrator should be wrapped in try/catch blocks that catch NumberFormatException.

* I am not sure I understand the migration code for tasks:

    public void migrateTask(ITask task, Element element) {
		String taskKind = element.getAttribute(KEY_TASK);
		task.setTaskKind(taskKind == null || taskKind.length() == 0 || taskKind.equals(TaskAttribute.KIND_DEFAULT) ? XPlannerAttributeMapper.XPlannerTaskKind.TASK.name()
				: taskKind);
	}
	
The task kind should be properly restored by the framework. Did you run into any migration problems during testing there? Interestingly XPlannerTask also had a "key" property which is different from taskKey in AbstractTask and as far as I can tell was never serialized to the task list.

* The lastReadTimestamp needs to be migrated for tasks, e.g.:

 task.setModificationDate(converStringToDate(element.getAttribute(KEY_LAST_MOD_DATE)));
 
The format of the string is the format that of the modification date that was stored in task data by the XPlanner in Mylyn 2.x. </thetext>

    <thetext>I think the problem was that somehow some of the tasks had the default Mylyn task kind attribute value, which was "task" with a small "t", and I was using my own set of these , which had different capitalization, and the kind checking I was doing failed -- that code just makes sure that I am starting in the right state.  I think I might have missed initializing the kind when I needed to, so I should probably check the task data initialization code to make sure I am covering all the settings.

I will follow your other suggestions and missed settings and add extra patches for that.  Thanks a lot.</thetext>

    <thetext>Okay, perfect. I'll add an XPlanner query to my migration testing and will check the results. The default migration might just work for XPlanner since the task editor is fairly customized.</thetext>

Steps To Reproduce:
1. Create a new XPlanner repository
2. Enter the username and password
3. Enable the http authentication and enter the username and password (this may be different from the username/password above)
4. Click Validate settings. The message 'The supplied credentials are invalid:  Invalid user name or password.' appears.

    <thetext>The XPlanner SOAP implementation looks very much like the one for JIRA. I am not sure if the HTTP authentication was ever tested (there is no JUnit test case). Helen, I'll add a test case for JIRA and comment here if I can get it to work.</thetext>

    <thetext>Steffen, thank you very much for checking this -- I am sure you will see more familiar pieces in the XPlanner connector, since it was really based on the Jira connector originally :-) -- it really helped to be able to see actual working code  and use that as a starting point for our implementation.</thetext>

updated client-config.wsdd to use custom httpsender class to pass http user/password

This patch will allow http/proxy configurations to work with XPlanner, as long as the extra username/password are the same as the basic XPlanner username/password.  
Debugging the XPlanner code, it looks like it uses the http credentials as the XPlanner search credentials to find an existing defined Person.  Still trying to figure out how to make different http username/password work.</thetext>

Patch for ensuring parent story doesn't get corrupted on new task add

&lt;patch&gt; Patch ensures new task data created through New Task XPlanner Editor contains enough basic settings so that parent story doesn't get corrupted when the new task is added to the repository.  
Currently the task appears to get added successfully, but because some properties (disposition, and possibly name) aren't set to default values, retrieving the task's parent story subsequently causes the server to error out when retrieving some related values, causing the story  and possibly even the iteration to become unusable.</thetext>

    <thetext>Both task and user story editor now have a hyperlink when task or story references are embedded in the description.  In XPlanner's web view, the hyperlink gets transformed from "task:&lt;taskid&gt;" to "task:&lt;task summary&gt;", but not in our editor.  This should be another bug -- not quite sure how to do this now other than by brute force.</thetext>

    <thetext>Mylyn should provide a tool tip displaying the summary if the task is in the task list which has worked well for the other connectors.</thetext>

    <thetext>Yes, you are right -- the tooltip does show up if the task is in the task list.  But I was actually doing my testing with a "search by id" found task, so didn't realize it works that way.  Would it be possible to extend the tooltip feature to the cases of non-task list items?  I think there's a good chance this might be the case, since there's a good chance references will probably be to bugs that weren't part of the original query.  I realize the code gets executed a lot, but maybe once found values can be cached for the lifetime of the opened task editor?</thetext>

    <thetext>That would indeed be an interesting feature. I am not sure if it is worth the complexity of triggering a background job and updating the tooltip after the synchronization completes but it could certainly be done. </thetext>
